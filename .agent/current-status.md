# Annual Reports CRM - Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-15 (Session 13 — DL-272 load more + DL-274 search)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13)

### DL-272: Dashboard Messages — Load More + Same-Day Sort Fix [COMPLETED]
- Client-side pagination: API returns all messages (no slice cap), frontend shows 10 at a time with "הצג עוד..." link
- Sort fix: inbound processor now stores full ISO timestamps; tiebreaker sort using note ID for existing date-only notes
- Delete/hide synced with in-memory `_allMessages` array

### DL-274: Dashboard Messages — Search Bar [COMPLETED]
- Search input in panel header with X clear button, debounced 300ms
- Fetch-once pattern: first search loads ALL messages across all years (cached 30 min in KV), subsequent keystrokes filter instantly client-side
- Spinner + "מחפש..." shown during initial fetch
- Variable name bug fix: `filterFormula` → `filterByFormula` (caused 500 on first deploy)
- Badge count removed from panel header per user feedback
- Workers deployed 3x this session

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 12)

### DL-273: Replace KV+Cron Queue with MS Graph Deferred Send [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Off-hours email queue used KV + daily cron (05:00 UTC). Cron fired at 07:00 Israel in winter (DST). Extra infrastructure for simple "send later".
- **Solution:** MS Graph `PidTagDeferredSendTime` — Exchange holds email in Outbox until 08:00 Israel. Eliminates cron entirely.
- **New methods:** `sendMailDeferred()` and `replyToMessageDeferred()` on MSGraphClient (draft→send with extended property)
- **Key change:** Airtable stage transitions happen immediately on off-hours approval (no longer delayed until cron)
- **Removed:** `email-queue.ts` (121 lines), `scheduled` handler, cron trigger from wrangler.toml
- **Files changed:** `ms-graph.ts`, `israel-time.ts`, `approve-and-send.ts`, `dashboard.ts`, `index.ts`, `wrangler.toml`
- Worker deployed: `a00a4e21-3db8-4ba2-9a09-df00bbef5b53`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/email/273-outlook-deferred-send.md`

### Cleanup: Remove Debug console.log [COMPLETED]
- Removed 3 debug `console.log` lines from `approve-and-send.ts` (added during DL-272)

**Test DL-273** — test plan in design log Section 7:
- [ ] Off-hours approve-and-send: email arrives at ~08:00 Israel
- [ ] Off-hours comment reply (threaded): arrives at ~08:00 in correct thread
- [ ] Off-hours comment reply (non-threaded): arrives at ~08:00
- [ ] Business-hours flows: unchanged (immediate send)
- [ ] UI toast + button show queued state on off-hours approval
- [ ] Airtable stage advances immediately on off-hours approval
- [ ] No cron errors in Worker logs

**Follow-up items:**
1. Consider clearing `queued_send_at` on next dashboard load after 08:00 passes (low priority — cosmetic)
2. Dashboard queued count on stage 3 card still works but shows count even after client moves to Collecting_Docs

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 11)

### DL-272: Dashboard Messages — Load More + Same-Day Sort Fix [IMPLEMENTED — NEED DEPLOY]
- **Load more:** Client-side pagination — API now returns all messages (no `slice(0, 10)` cap), frontend shows 10 at a time with "הצג עוד..." link
- **Sort fix:** Inbound processor (`processor.ts:349`) was stripping time from dates (`.split('T')[0]`), causing same-day messages to appear in random order. Now stores full ISO timestamp. Added tiebreaker sort using note ID timestamp for existing date-only notes.
- **State sync:** Delete/hide now removes from in-memory `_allMessages` array and re-renders (not just DOM manipulation)
- **Files changed:** `api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `frontend/admin/js/script.js`, `frontend/admin/css/style.css`
- **Blocked:** Workers deploy failed due to network issue — need to run `npx wrangler deploy` from `api/` directory
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/272-dashboard-messages-load-more.md`

**Test TODO (DL-272):**
- [ ] Deploy Workers: `cd api && npx wrangler deploy`
- [ ] Dashboard shows first 10 messages, "הצג עוד..." link visible
- [ ] Click load more → 10 more messages appear, link updates count
- [ ] Link disappears when all messages shown
- [ ] Badge shows total count
- [ ] Same-day messages sorted newest-first
- [ ] Delete/hide still works after load more
- [ ] Reply still works after load more
- [ ] Mobile layout not broken

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 11b)

### Fix Negative/Wrong Days in מוכנים להכנה Tab [COMPLETED]
- **Bug 1:** `(-1) ימים` showed when `docs_completed_at` was slightly ahead of browser time (timezone offset)
- **Fix 1:** `Math.max(0, ...)` clamp on `diffDays`
- **Bug 2:** Yesterday's date showed "היום" instead of "יום אחד" — timestamp diff < 24h but different calendar day
- **Fix 2:** Compare midnight-to-midnight dates instead of raw timestamps (both desktop table + mobile cards)
- File changed: `frontend/admin/js/script.js` (lines 2587-2589, 2634-2636)

### Skill & Memory Updates
- `/design-log` Phase 0: added stale worktree cleanup step (`git worktree list`)
- Memory: `feedback_worktree_cleanup.md` — ExitWorktree won't work for CLI `--worktree`

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 10)

### WF07 Daily Digest — IF Node Type Validation Fix [COMPLETED]
- **Bug:** "IF Has Client Emails" node in WF07 (`0o6pXPeewCRxEEhd`) failed with "Wrong type: '' is a string but was expecting a boolean" at 20:00 cron run
- **Root cause:** `typeValidation: "strict"` on the IF node rejected empty string when `$json._hasClients` was undefined/falsy
- **Fix:** Changed `typeValidation` from `"strict"` to `"loose"` via n8n REST API — matches the "Skip Weekend" IF node pattern in the same workflow
- No local file changes — fix applied directly to n8n

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 9)

### DL-272: Port DL-266 Send-Comment Endpoint + Fix Approve-and-Send [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- Ported full DL-266 API implementation from old repo (`annual-reports-old` branch `DL-266-reply-to-client-messages`)
- **New endpoint:** `POST /webhook/admin-send-comment` in `dashboard.ts` — reply to client messages with branded email, off-hours queue, Outlook threading
- **New email builder:** `buildCommentEmailHtml()` + `buildCommentEmailSubject()` in `email-html.ts`
- **New MS Graph method:** `replyToMessage()` — two-step createReply+send for Outlook thread continuity
- **New cron handler:** `processQueuedComments()` in `email-queue.ts` — processes `queued_comment:*` KV keys
- **Reply map:** GET `/admin-recent-messages` now returns `reply` field per message for threaded display
- **Bug fix:** `showAIToast` → `showToast` in doc-manager queued handler — this was the actual cause of the off-hours approve-and-send error since DL-264
- **Bug fix:** `queued_send_at` Airtable update wrapped in try/catch (non-critical)
- **Persistent button lock:** Doc-manager shows "⏰ ישלח ב-08:00" (disabled) on page load when `queued_send_at` is set
- **Hook removed:** `banned-frontend-patterns.js` — was blocking debug and not useful enough to keep
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/266-reply-to-client-messages.md` (ported from old repo)
- Worker deployed 4x, all changes merged to main

~~**Test DL-272**~~ — NOT TESTED (test plan: `.agent/test-plan-2026-04-15.md` Suite 1)

**Follow-up items (next session):**
1. **Dashboard queued-client visibility** — queued clients in Pending_Approval should show ⏰ badge + grayed row in dashboard table so other users don't double-approve. Remove ugly "(X בתור לשליחה)" from stat card.
2. **Queued reply timestamp** — dashboard messages panel shows the note's save time (e.g. "20:34") for queued replies, but the email won't send until 08:00. Should show "יישלח ב-08:00 ⏰" instead of the save timestamp. Also fix all "ישלח" → "יישלח" and move ⏰ emoji to left side (RTL) across doc-manager button text.
3. **Verify morning cron** — check at 08:00 Israel time (05:00 UTC) that both queued approve-and-send emails AND queued comment replies actually fire.
4. **Outlook deferred send** — replace KV+cron queue with MS Graph `PidTagDeferredSendTime` (scheduled send). Simpler architecture, Outlook handles delivery timing. Eliminates `processQueuedEmails`/`processQueuedComments` cron entirely.
5. **Remove debug console.log** — 3 temporary `console.log` lines in doc-manager approve-and-send handler.

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 8)

### DL-268: AI Review Pagination by Client + FIFO Sort [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- Pagination now counts **client groups** (25/page) instead of documents (was 50 docs/page)
- FIFO sort: oldest-waiting client appears first (by earliest `received_at` ascending)
- Summary bar shows total doc/client counts across ALL pages, not just current page
- File changed: `frontend/admin/js/script.js`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/268-ai-review-pagination.md`
- Commits: `4f08176`, `90c0c6e` (sync to frontend/ path)

### Root-Level Frontend Duplicates Removed [COMPLETED]
- Deleted 40 root-level files (admin/, assets/, shared/, n8n/, *.html) — 29,725 lines
- `frontend/` is now the sole canonical location for all frontend files
- GitHub Pages deploys from `frontend/**` only (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
- Commit: `63d283e`

### Design-Log Skill Updated
- Phase D Step 7: auto-merge to main after push (no "merge to main?" question)
- Merge IS the deploy for testing on GitHub Pages

~~**Test DL-268**~~ — NOT TESTED (test plan: `.agent/test-plan-2026-04-15.md` Suite 2)

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 7)

### n8n Workflow URL Migration [COMPLETED]
- Migrated all 6 active n8n workflows from `liozshor.github.io/annual-reports-client-portal` to `docs.moshe-atsits.com`
- 19 total occurrences replaced (URLs in Code nodes + CORS headers)
- Workflows updated: [SUB] Document Service (4), [06] Reminder Scheduler (4), [API] Send Batch Status (6), [04] Document Edit Handler (2), [MONITOR] Security Alerts (1), [07] Daily Natan Digest (2)
- CORS: Edit Handler webhook keeps both origins for backward compat; Batch Status respond nodes switched to new domain
- Also committed `.dev.vars*` gitignore entries
- Commit: `78a2b59` on main

**TODO (carried forward):**
- [x] ~~Update n8n workflow URLs to use custom domain~~ (done this session)
- [ ] Verify `docs.moshe-atsits.com` admin login works (CORS resolved)
- [ ] Delete root-level duplicate frontend files (separate PR after stability confirmed)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 6)

### Session Start Enforcement Hooks [IMPLEMENTED]
- **`session-start-check.sh`** (SessionStart hook) — warns on main/master branch + uncommitted changes + worktree detection
- **`branch-guard.sh`** (PreToolUse hook) — blocks Edit/Write on main/master (exit 2), runs before all other Edit|Write hooks
- Both wired in `.claude/settings.json`, tested live (branch-guard blocked a write mid-session)
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/DL-SESSION-START-ENFORCEMENT.md`
- Branch: `feat/session-start-enforcement` (pushed, not yet merged to main)

### Design-Log Skill Updated (Global)
- Phase A step 0: worktree-aware branch setup — detects parallel sessions, offers `git worktree add`
- Phase D step 7: worktree cleanup after merge — `git worktree remove` prompt
- File: `~/.claude/skills/design-log/SKILL.md` (global, not git-tracked)

### Custom Domain CNAME + CORS Fix [DEPLOYED]
- Created `frontend/CNAME` → `docs.moshe-atsits.com` (committed to main, `88cfeda`)
- CORS middleware updated to accept comma-separated origins (Hono `string[]`)
- `wrangler.toml` `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` now includes: `liozshor.github.io`, `docs.moshe-atsits.com` (https + http)
- Worker deployed (`f24e08a1`)

**TODO:**
- [ ] Merge `feat/session-start-enforcement` to main (2 commits: hooks + CORS fix)
- [ ] Verify `docs.moshe-atsits.com` admin login works (CORS resolved)
- [ ] Set up HTTPS for custom domain (currently included http:// as fallback)
- [ ] Update `FRONTEND_BASE` constants in Workers code to use custom domain (email links still point to github.io)

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 5)

### DL-MONOREPO: Git Monorepo Migration [IMPLEMENTED — MONITORING]
- **What:** Merged outer local-only repo into GitHub repo (`LiozShor/annual-reports-client-portal`). Single repo, single remote, worktrees work natively.
- **Structure:** `frontend/` = GitHub Pages (deployed via GitHub Actions), `api/` = Cloudflare Workers, `docs/`, `.claude/`, `.agent/` = project tooling
- **Root frontend files kept** for backward compat — delete in separate PR after 1-2 days stability
- **Secrets protected:** `.env`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `archive/keys.txt`, `docs/wf05-backup-*.json` all gitignored. Airtable PAT in design log 112 redacted.
- **Hooks updated:** 3 hooks had hardcoded `github/annual-reports-client-portal/` → changed to `frontend/`
- **Path refs updated:** CLAUDE.md, airtable-safety.md, SSOT docs, architecture.md, project-overview.md, cs-hardcoded-audit.md, ssot-verify skill, n8n comment URLs

**TODO:**
- [ ] Rename local directories after closing this Claude Code session: `mv annual-reports annual-reports-OLD && mv annual-reports-monorepo annual-reports`
- [ ] Delete root-level duplicate frontend files (separate PR after 1-2 days of stability)
- [ ] Delete `annual-reports-OLD` after confirming everything works for a week
- [ ] Test full worktree workflow with a real ticket
- [ ] Update memory files that reference `github/annual-reports-client-portal/`

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 4)

### DL-267: Auto-Advance to Review When Zero Docs Remaining [VERIFIED ✓]
- **Feature:** Reports with `docs_missing_count === 0` in `Pending_Approval` or `Collecting_Docs` auto-advance to `Review`. No manual office action needed.
- **Manually tested 2026-04-14:** CPA-XXX reduced to 2 docs, both waived → auto-advanced to Review. All validation items passed.

**TODO:** Remove backfill endpoint after confirming no more stuck reports.

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 3)

### DL-265: Entity Tab Switch Loading Indicator + UX Polish [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Loading indicator:** Bouncing dots loader with Hebrew text ("טוען לוח בקרה…", etc.) on entity tab switch (AR↔CS). White frosted overlay + backdrop-blur, fade-in animation.
- **Mobile auto-scroll:** Tapping a stat card filter on mobile now smooth-scrolls to the client table.
- **New tab navigation:** Clicking client name in dashboard table opens doc-manager in a new tab (desktop only; mobile stays same-tab).
- **Multi-tab safety rules:** Added global + project rules to prevent parallel Claude Code sessions from clobbering each other's uncommitted changes. Updated skills: git-ship (pre-ship validation), debug, qa-test, silent-failure-hunt, ssot-verify.
- **Files changed:** `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/index.html`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, 5 skill files

**Test DL-265:**
- [ ] Switch AR→CS on dashboard → bouncing dots + "טוען לוח בקרה…" overlay appears, disappears on load
- [ ] Same on Send/Questionnaires/Reminders tabs → correct Hebrew label per tab
- [ ] Mobile: stat card tap → page scrolls to table
- [ ] Mobile: bouncing dots appear with padding-top:80px (smaller gap)
- [ ] Desktop: click client name → doc-manager opens in new tab
- [ ] Mobile: tap client name → doc-manager opens in same tab

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 2)

### DL-264: Off-Hours Email Queue [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Feature:** Approve-and-send during 8PM-8AM (Israel time) queues emails in KV, delivered at ~8AM by Worker cron trigger. Sub-status on Pending_Approval stage (not a new pipeline stage).
- **Backend:** New `israel-time.ts` (DST-safe via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`), `email-queue.ts` (morning batch processor). Modified `approve-and-send.ts` to fork on `isOffHours()`. Added `scheduled` handler to `index.ts`. Cron `0 5 * * *` in `wrangler.toml`.
- **Frontend:** `document-manager.js` shows "⏰ ישלח ב-08:00" + toast on queued approval. `approve-confirm.html` has queued success state. Dashboard stage 3 card shows "(N בתור לשליחה)" subtitle.
- **Airtable:** New `queued_send_at` field (dateTime, `fld18iNopKSFdbXxX`).
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/israel-time.ts`, `api/src/lib/email-queue.ts`, `api/src/routes/approve-and-send.ts`, `api/src/index.ts`, `api/wrangler.toml`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `document-manager.js`, `approve-confirm.html`, `admin/js/script.js`

**Test DL-264:**
- [ ] Approve client after 20:00 Israel → response says queued, KV key created, Airtable has queued_send_at
- [ ] Approve client 08:00-20:00 Israel → sends immediately (unchanged behavior)
- [ ] Dashboard shows queued count on stage 3 card
- [ ] Document manager shows "⏰ ישלח ב-08:00" badge after off-hours approval
- [ ] approve-confirm.html shows queued success page with clock icon
- [ ] Trigger cron manually → queued emails send, stage → Collecting_Docs, KV keys deleted
- [ ] Duplicate off-hours approval → KV key overwrites (idempotent)
- [ ] No regression: daytime approve-and-send works identically

## Session Summary (2026-04-14)

### DL-263: Dashboard Messages — Delete/Hide + Raw Text Only [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Feature:** Replaced AI summaries with raw email text in dashboard messages panel. Added delete/hide option with inline action buttons.
- **API:** New `delete-client-note` action in `client.ts` (permanent delete or hide-from-dashboard with `hidden_from_dashboard` flag). Added `note.id` to recent-messages response. Filters hidden notes server-side. KV cache invalidation on mutation.
- **Frontend:** Raw snippet shown inline (2-line clamp), hover expands full text on desktop, tap-to-expand on mobile. Two always-visible action buttons per row: folder-open (opens doc-manager in new tab) + trash (inline delete/hide actions). Inline action panel replaces row content (no modal).
- **Files:** `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `api/src/routes/client.ts`, `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/index.html` (cache bust v=263b)

**Test DL-263:**
- [ ] Messages show raw email text in quotes (not AI summary)
- [ ] Hover on desktop expands full text (removes 2-line clamp)
- [ ] Tap on mobile toggles expanded/collapsed
- [ ] Folder-open icon opens doc-manager in new tab
- [ ] Trash icon shows inline actions: "מחק לצמיתות" / "הסתר מהדשבורד" / "ביטול"
- [ ] "מחק לצמיתות" permanently removes note from Airtable + dashboard
- [ ] "הסתר מהדשבורד" hides from dashboard but note remains in doc-manager
- [ ] "ביטול" restores original row content
- [ ] After delete/hide, row fades out, badge count updates
- [ ] Refresh page: deleted/hidden messages stay gone
- [ ] No regression: clients table still works

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 4)

### DL-261: Dashboard Recent Client Messages Panel [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Feature:** Sticky side panel on dashboard showing 10 most recent client emails
- **API:** New `GET /admin-recent-messages` endpoint with 5-min KV cache
- **Frontend:** 2-column grid layout, hover shows raw snippet as blockquote, click navigates to doc-manager
- **Files:** `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `admin/index.html`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/js/script.js`, `shared/endpoints.js`

### DL-262: WF05 Email Note Quality [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Raw snippets had quoted replies, signatures, `&quot;` entities; summaries described our own outbound template
- **Fix:** Added `stripQuotedContent()` pre-strip, switched Haiku to `tool_use` structured extraction, fixed entity decoding
- **Backfill:** 10 records re-processed with clean summaries and snippets
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`

**Test DL-261:**
- [ ] Panel loads with messages next to clients table
- [x] Click navigates to correct client doc-manager (now opens in new tab via DL-263)
- [x] Hover shows raw snippet inline (DL-263: raw text is now primary, hover expands)
- [ ] Mobile (<900px): panel stacks above table
- [ ] Clients table still works (filters, pagination)

**Test DL-262:**
- [ ] New inbound email → summary describes only client's new content
- [ ] Raw snippet has no signatures or quoted chains
- [ ] No `&quot;` entities in stored data
- [ ] Backfilled records show clean data in dashboard

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 3)

### DL-259: Capture Client Notes & Attachments at All Stages [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Inbound email processor only looked for reports at Collecting_Docs/Review. Emails from earlier/later stages silently dropped (NeedsHuman).
- **Fix:** Added `getAllReports` (no stage filter). Two-tier flow: always save note + raw upload, only classify at Collecting_Docs/Review.
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts`
- **Worker version:** `aa1964f1`

**Test DL-259:**
- [ ] Trigger inbound email for CPA-XXX (Waiting_For_Answers) → client_notes populated
- [ ] Email event marked Completed
- [ ] Collecting_Docs client: full classification still works
- [ ] Truly unknown client: still NeedsHuman
- [ ] Doc-manager shows note via DL-258 secondary zone

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 2)

### DL-258: Client Messages on Low-Stage Doc Manager [DONE]
- **Problem:** Stage 1 doc manager early-returns before showing secondary zone (notes, client messages, rejected uploads). Clients may email before filling questionnaire — office can't see those messages.
- **Fix:** Extracted `.secondary-zone` HTML from `#content` into standalone `#secondaryZone` sibling. JS shows it at all stages independently.
- **Files:** `document-manager.html`, `assets/js/document-manager.js`
- **Commit:** `798e06e` (submodule)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 1)

### DL-257: Mobile Bottom Nav Auth Gate [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Bottom nav visible on login screen before auth (bfcache + FOUC)
- **Fix:** `style="display:none"` on `#bottomNav`, replace CSS sibling selector with `.bottom-nav.visible`, add JS `.visible` at 3 auth points, add `pageshow` bfcache guard
- **Files:** `admin/index.html`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/js/script.js`
- **Commit:** `0ab131d`

**Test DL-257 nav gate:**
- [ ] Fresh load on mobile (no session) — login screen shows, bottom nav hidden
- [ ] Login on mobile — bottom nav appears after auth
- [ ] Refresh page (with session) — bottom nav reappears
- [ ] Slow 3G DevTools — no FOUC flash
- [ ] Desktop — bottom nav stays hidden (no regression)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 7)

### DL-257: Reminder Select-All Bug Fix & Bulk Cap [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** "Select all" in reminders tab shows 100 selected (not 50). Root cause: each item renders 2 `.reminder-checkbox` elements (desktop table + mobile card) sharing same value. Also no bulk cap like questionnaires tab.
- **Fix:** Dedup all checkbox queries via `Set`, added `MAX_BULK_SEND=50` cap to `toggleSectionSelectAll` and `toggleReminderSelectAll`, disable unchecked boxes at limit
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`

**Test DL-257:**
- [ ] Click section "select all" → count shows 50 (not 100)
- [ ] Unchecked checkboxes disabled at limit
- [ ] Uncheck one → re-enables unchecked boxes
- [ ] Bulk send → 50 unique report IDs sent
- [ ] Mobile view: same behavior
- [ ] Navigate to page 2 → can select another batch
- [ ] Muted client warning still works
- [ ] Cancel selection → all checkboxes cleared and re-enabled

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 6)

### DL-256: Table Pagination — 50 Rows Per Page [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** 579 clients → 1.5-2.5s icon creation, 852-2484ms click handler violations
- **Fix:** Shared `renderPagination()` utility with Hebrew RTL pagination bar (« הקודם | 1 2 3 ... | הבא »)
- **All 4 tables paginated:** Dashboard clients, questionnaires, reminders, AI review cards
- **Reminders fix:** Per-section pagination (Type A / Type B each get independent pagination inside accordion)
- **DL-255 hide/show logic replaced** — pagination renders only 50 rows, eliminating DOM bottleneck
- **Scoped `safeCreateIcons(root)`** — icon creation scoped to container element (no full-document scan)
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/index.html`

**Test DL-256:**
- [ ] Login → dashboard shows 50 rows, pagination bar at bottom
- [ ] Click page 2 → next 50 rows shown
- [ ] Stage filter → resets to page 1, correct total
- [ ] Search → resets to page 1
- [ ] "מציג 1-50 מתוך N" label correct
- [ ] Stat cards still show full totals
- [ ] Questionnaires, reminders, AI review paginated
- [ ] No timeout errors on dashboard load

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 5)

### Bug Fix: Infinite Reload Loop [PUSHED]
- **Problem:** Fresh visit (no token) → `DOMContentLoaded→switchEntityTab→loadDashboard` with empty auth → API returns unauthorized → `logout()→location.reload()` → infinite loop
- **Fix:** Added `if (!authToken) return;` guard to all 5 data-loading functions
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`

### DL-254: Dashboard Load Performance [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** 10 API calls on returning user (dashboard x2, classifications x3, pending x2, reminders x2). 579 clients.
- **Fixes:**
  - Fix double-load: `loadedAt > 0` guards in `switchEntityTab` prevent duplicate loads on init
  - Dedup `loadAIReviewCount` via `deduplicatedFetch` (was `fetchWithTimeout`)
  - Fix timeout mismatch: `loadAIReviewCount` uses `FETCH_TIMEOUTS.slow` to match shared dedup request
  - Stagger prefetches in `requestIdleCallback` — dashboard renders first
  - Bump AI review + reminders timeout 10s → 20s
  - **API:** KV-cache `available_years` (1hr TTL), invalidate on rollover
  - **API:** KV-cache `documents_non_waived` (5min TTL), invalidate on approve/review
  - **API:** Parallelize sequential batch report fetches in classifications endpoint
- **Results:** Returning user: 10 → 5 API calls (50% reduction). Worker deployed.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/254-dashboard-load-performance.md`

**Test DL-254:**
- [ ] Returning user reload → exactly 1 `admin-dashboard`, 1 `get-pending-classifications` in Network tab
- [ ] Fresh login → dashboard renders, prefetches fire after
- [ ] AI Review tab loads without error
- [ ] Reminders tab loads without error

### DL-255: Table Rendering Performance [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Every filter keystroke triggers full innerHTML rebuild of 578 rows + 2300 Lucide icon re-creations
- **Fixes:**
  - Hide/show pattern for dashboard clients table: render ALL entity-filtered rows once, toggle `display:none` for search/stage/year
  - 150ms debounce on all 4 search inputs
  - CSS `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen table rows
- **Results:** Stage filter: 21ms, search: 13ms, back-to-all: 20ms (all <25ms, was 6700ms+)
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/255-table-rendering-performance.md`

### DL-251: View Documents — Filing Type Badge [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Dual AR+CS clients couldn't tell which filing type they were viewing on the view-documents page. Tabs existed (DL-218) but were too subtle.
- **Fix:** Added a color-coded pill badge in the header area (blue for AR, purple for CS). Reuses admin panel badge pattern. Only shows for dual-filing clients. Updates on tab switch and language change.
- **Files:** `view-documents.css`, `view-documents.html`, `view-documents.js`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/client-portal/251-view-documents-filing-type-badge.md`

**Test DL-251:**
- [ ] Single-filing AR client: no badge visible
- [ ] Dual AR+CS client: badge visible in header
- [ ] Switch tabs: badge updates (text + color)
- [ ] Switch language: badge text updates (HE/EN)
- [ ] Mobile: badge doesn't break header layout

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 3)

### DL-250: Entity Tab Switch Fix [COMPLETED]
- **Problem:** Switching AR↔CS entity tabs on the dashboard didn't reload data; on the import tab, content stayed faded at 50% opacity.
- **Root causes:** (1) `switchEntityTab()` set `dashboardLoaded=false` then checked `if(dashboardLoaded)` (dead code), and the reload section had no `dashboard` case. (2) `.tab-refreshing` class applied to ALL tabs but only removed for tabs with load functions — import tab stuck at 50% opacity.
- **Fixes:** Added dashboard case to reload section, removed dead code block, restructured `.tab-refreshing` to only apply to tabs that actually fetch data.
- **Bonus:** Added filing type badge to import tab header for visual feedback.
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/index.html`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/250-entity-tab-switch-dashboard-reload.md`

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 2)

### DL-243: CS Help Text Import [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Context:** Natan returned filled Excel with Hebrew help text for CS document templates (view-documents `?` icons).
- **Imported:** 16/22 CS templates with `help_he` (6 intentionally empty — self-explanatory docs).
- **English:** Generated and imported `help_en` translations for all 16 templates.
- **Fixes:** Hardcoded "31.12.2025" → "31.12.{year}" in CS-T010 and CS-T018.
- **Cache:** KV `cache:templates` purged — changes are live.
- **No code changes** — existing pipeline serves CS help text identically to AR.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/capital-statements/243-cs-help-text-content.md`

**Test DL-243:**
- [ ] Open a CS client's view-documents page — `?` icons appear next to documents
- [ ] Click `?` → accordion expands with Hebrew help text
- [ ] Toggle language → English help text shows
- [ ] Documents with `{year}` placeholder show correct year (not "2025")
- [ ] Empty templates (CS-T004, T006, T007, T012, T019, T020) show no `?` icon
- [ ] AR view-documents still works unchanged (regression)

## Session Summary (2026-04-12)

### DL-248: Fix Upload Document Endpoint [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Admin upload in doc-manager.html returned 400: "Report has no OneDrive root folder configured"
- **Root causes:** (1) `upload-document.ts` read `onedrive_root_folder_id` from report record (doesn't exist — field is on clients table). (2) Used `display_name`/`name` fields (don't exist on documents table) — every file saved as "document.pdf".
- **Fix:** Replaced with `resolveOneDriveRoot()` + `uploadToOneDrive()` from attachment-utils. Changed filename source to `issuer_name` field.
- **Also:** Refreshed 31 stale `file_url` values via temp endpoint. Renamed 7 old `דוחות שנתיים` folders to `דוח שנתי`. Cleared 1 broken item (אלביט — deleted from OneDrive).
- **Files:** `api/src/routes/upload-document.ts`

**Test DL-248:**
- [x] Upload file via doc-manager — no 400 error
- [ ] Verify uploaded file appears in OneDrive with correct Hebrew document name
- [ ] Verify Airtable doc record updated: file_url, onedrive_item_id, status=Received

### DL-249: Auto-Create Client OneDrive Folders [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** OneDrive folders only created on-demand during first upload. New clients had no folder structure.
- **Solution:** `createClientFolderStructure()` helper creates full `clientName/year/filingType/` hierarchy. Wired into bulk import + year rollover. Backfill ran: 40/40 existing combos, 0 errors.
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/inbound/attachment-utils.ts`, `api/src/routes/import.ts`, `api/src/routes/rollover.ts`

**Test DL-249:**
- [ ] Bulk import with new test client — verify folder appears in OneDrive
- [ ] Year rollover — verify new year folder created
- [ ] Verify existing upload/inbound flows still work (no regression)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-09 — Part 2)

### DL-247: Tab Switching Performance & Smart Loading [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Full-screen blocking overlay ("טוען סיווגים...") shown on every tab switch, even when data is cached. AI review never prefetched.
- **Solution:** Stale-while-revalidate pattern — show cached data instantly, refresh silently in background. Full-screen overlay reserved for mutations only.
- **Key changes:**
  - Removed `showLoading`/`hideLoading` from all 5 tab load functions
  - Added `*LoadedAt` timestamps + `STALE_AFTER_MS = 30s` staleness check
  - `switchTab()` always passes `silent=true` (was passing `*Loaded` flag)
  - AI review added to dashboard prefetch list
  - `deduplicatedFetch` (existing but unused) wired into 3 GET-based loaders (pending, AI review, questionnaires)
  - Fixed `deduplicatedFetch` to clone responses (Response body can only be read once)
  - `switchEntityTab()` uses opacity fade instead of full-screen overlay
  - First-ever tab load shows inline CSS spinner (`.tab-loading-inline`)
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/css/style.css`, `assets/js/resilient-fetch.js`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/247-tab-switching-performance.md`

**Test DL-247:**
- [ ] Switch to AI Review tab on first visit — no full-screen overlay, inline spinner or instant load
- [ ] Switch back to Dashboard after visiting AI Review — instant, no loading indicator
- [ ] Switch filing type (AR → CS) — no full-screen overlay, brief opacity fade
- [ ] Rapid tab switching — no duplicate API calls (check Network tab)
- [ ] After 30+ seconds, switch tab — silent background refresh fires
- [ ] Mutations (bulk send, save settings, mark complete) still show full-screen overlay
- [ ] Auto-refresh (5-min interval) still works silently
- [ ] Page visibility return still refreshes silently
- [ ] AI Review tab loads instantly after dashboard (prefetched)

## Session Summary (2026-04-09)

### DL-246: Split Modal Page Preview & Zoom [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** PDF split modal thumbnails (scale 0.2, ~120px) too small to read page content. Admins can't decide how to group pages.
- **Solution:** Lightbox-style page preview overlay with zoom/pan controls.
- **Features:** Hover magnify icon on thumbnails, lightbox with full-size page render (pdf.js scale 1.5), left/right arrow navigation, zoom controls (+/- buttons, scroll wheel, double-click toggle), drag-to-pan when zoomed, full keyboard support (arrows/Escape/+/-).
- **Files touched:** `github/.../admin/index.html`, `github/.../admin/css/style.css`, `github/.../admin/js/script.js`.
- **Code review fixes:** Canvas backing store release, `closeSplitModal` → `closePagePreview` chain, render race guard, `||` → `??` falsy-zero fix.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/246-split-modal-page-preview-zoom.md`

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-07 — Part 3)

### DL-244: Rejected Uploads Visibility [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** When admin rejects an AI classification, the source upload (filename + date + reason) is lost. Client never learns we received a file we couldn't use; same docs keep being requested in approve-and-send + reminders.
- **Critical constraint:** Doc records must stay `Required_Missing` (NOT `Requires_Fix`) — the reject acts on the AI's *guess at a template slot*, not the client's actual document. Marking template slots would lie to the client about what they sent.
- **Solution:** New `rejected_uploads_log` JSON field on Reports table. Reject flow appends `{filename, received_at, reason_code, reason_text, notes, ...}` per rejection. Auto-clears when stage advances past Collecting_Docs.
- **Surfaces:** Amber callout titled "מסמכים שקיבלנו ממך בעבר" rendered above missing-docs list in:
  - approve-and-send email (Workers `email-html.ts` shared helper)
  - Type B reminder email (n8n WF06, both HE and EN branches)
  - Client portal view-documents.html
  - Admin doc-manager (with delete-only action under הודעות הלקוח)
- **Files touched:** `api/src/routes/{classifications,client,client-reports,stage,approve-and-send}.ts`, `api/src/lib/email-html.ts`, `github/.../assets/js/{view-documents,document-manager}.js`, `github/.../document-manager.html`, `github/.../admin/css/style.css`, `github/.../view-documents.html`, n8n workflow `FjisCdmWc4ef0qSV` (Search Due Reminders + Prepare Type B Input + Build Type B Email), `docs/airtable-schema.md`, design log `documents/244-rejected-uploads-visibility.md`.
- **Build:** `cd api && npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Not yet deployed/tested:** Worker deploy + manual end-to-end test plan in current-status TODO #0 + design log Section 7.

## Session Summary (2026-04-07 — Part 2)

### CS Questionnaire Labels — Strip `cs_` Prefix [COMPLETED]
- Bug: CS questionnaire columns in Airtable are prefixed with `cs_` (DL-182, to disambiguate from AR in shared submissions table). Prefix was leaking into the WF02 "full questionnaire" email, the admin questionnaires tab (view + print), and the doc-manager questionnaire panel (view + print). In RTL, `cs_חשבון בנק עסקי` rendered as `חשבון בנק עסקי_cs`.
- Investigated alternatives: renaming Airtable columns would require updating Tally→Airtable mapping, n8n WF02, `workflow-processor-n8n.js`, `question_mappings` rows, and `format-questionnaire.ts` hidden-field lists in lockstep. Rejected as too risky.
- **Fix:** One-line strip in `api/src/lib/format-questionnaire.ts:127` — `key.replace(/^cs_/, '')` before pushing to `answerEntries`. All four surfaces read `answers[].label` from this single formatter, so the server-side strip covers everything.
- **Deployed:** Worker version `13f18aca-d92a-4fb1-9828-a4de04b42b35`. Commit `2405e9b` (local outer repo only — no remote).
- Works for existing CS submissions immediately on next page load.

## Session Summary (2026-04-07)

### DL-242: Questionnaires-Tab Print — Notes & Client Questions [COMPLETED]
- Bug: printing from admin → questionnaires tab (single + bulk) omitted "שאלות הלקוח" and "הערות משרד" sections that DO appear when printing the same client from doc-manager.
- Root cause: `api/src/routes/questionnaires.ts` never returned `notes` per item; print fell back to a fragile `clientsData.find(...)` cross-reference. Client-questions parser also silently swallowed parse failures.
- **Worker fix:** API now fetches and returns `notes` + `filing_type` per item alongside the existing `client_questions`.
- **Frontend fix:** `generateQuestionnairePrintHTML` now reads `item.notes` / `item.filing_type` directly. Client-questions parser hardened to warn on bad JSON.
- **Deployed:** Worker `ecda4169-3084-4667-a87e-f52e9fce0e95`, submodule `4a687cd`. **Verified working in production.**

## Session Summary (2026-04-06 — Part 2)

### DL-238: Unified AI Review Tab (Both AR & CS)
- AI Review tab now loads all classifications regardless of entity tab (`filing_type=all`)
- Each card shows a filing type badge (`.ai-filing-type-badge` — blue for AR, purple for CS)
- Tab badge count is combined across filing types
- `switchEntityTab()` no longer invalidates AI Review cache (data unchanged)
- API: `classifications.ts` accepts `filing_type=all` and adds `filing_type` to response items
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING

### DL-239: Cross-Filing-Type Reassign
- Reassign combobox now supports cross-type — toggle buttons inside dropdown switch between AR/CS doc lists
- Toggle appears at the top of the dropdown only when client has BOTH active reports
- API: `clientToReports` map built from Airtable reports query (covers clients without pending classifications in sibling type)
- API: `target_report_id` param accepted in POST reassign for "create new doc" cross-type path
- Combobox dropdown re-anchors on window scroll/resize (was drifting away from input)
- Click input again while open closes dropdown (toggle behavior)
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING

### DL-241: CS Template short_name_he Issuer Placeholders
- Discovered CS docs in reassign combobox showed generic template names ("אישור מס – פנסיה") instead of per-issuer names
- Root cause: CS templates' `short_name_he` field in Airtable lacked `{varName}` placeholders that AR templates have
- Pure data fix — updated 17 CS template records via pyairtable
- Cleared `cache:templates` KV key in Workers
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING

### Test DL-238/239/241
  - [ ] AI Review tab shows both AR and CS classifications regardless of entity tab
  - [ ] Each card shows filing type badge (דוח שנתי / הצהרת הון)
  - [ ] Tab badge count is combined
  - [ ] Approve/reject/reassign still work
  - [ ] Reassign combobox shows toggle for clients with both AR+CS
  - [ ] Toggle switches the doc list to other filing type
  - [ ] Cross-type reassign succeeds (verify in Airtable)
  - [ ] Combobox dropdown stays anchored when scrolling page
  - [ ] Clicking input again while open closes the dropdown
  - [ ] CS docs in combobox show issuer names (e.g., "אישור מס – פנסיה – פנסיה1")
  Design logs: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/238-unified-ai-review-both-filing-types.md`, `239-cross-filing-type-reassign.md`, `capital-statements/241-cs-template-short-names.md`

### UI Design System Update
- Added `.ai-filing-type-badge` and `.doc-combobox-ft-toggle` patterns to `docs/ui-design-system-full.md`
- Documented combobox scroll/click behaviors

## Session Summary (2026-04-06)
- **DL-240:** Remove OneDrive subfolders (זוהו / ממתינים לזיהוי / מסמכים שזוהו)
  - Removed `folder` param from `uploadToOneDrive()` in `attachment-utils.ts`
  - Removed subfolder logic from `processor.ts` (both inbound paths)
  - Removed `/מסמכים שזוהו` from admin upload path in `upload-document.ts`
  - Removed `moveToZohu` from `classifications.ts`, simplified archive to 2-level traversal
  - All docs now land directly in filing type root: `{year}/דוח שנתי/filename.pdf`
  - **Deployed:** Build passes, pending deploy + manual testing

### Test DL-240: Remove OneDrive Subfolders
  - [x] Build passes (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
  - [ ] Inbound email → attachment uploads to `{year}/דוח שנתי/filename.pdf` (no subfolder)
  - [ ] Admin upload → file goes to `{year}/דוח שנתי/filename.pdf`
  - [ ] AI Review reject → file moves to `{year}/ארכיון/`
  - [ ] AI Review approve → file renamed in place
  - [ ] AI Review reassign → file renamed in place (no move)
  - [ ] Existing files in old subfolders still accessible
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/documents/240-remove-onedrive-subfolders.md`

## Session Summary (2026-04-05)
- **DL-237:** PDF split & re-classify from AI review
  - Created `api/src/lib/pdf-split.ts` — `splitPdf()` and `getPdfPageCount()` using pdf-lib
  - Added page count capture in `processor.ts` during inbound email processing
  - Added 3 Airtable fields: `page_count`, `split_from`, `page_range` to CLASSIFICATIONS table
  - Added `action=split` handler to `POST /webhook/review-classification` in `classifications.ts`
  - Added `/webhook/download-file` proxy endpoint for CSP-safe PDF download
  - Frontend: split banner on AI review cards when `page_count >= 2`, split modal with pdf.js thumbnails
  - Two split modes: "Split All" (one page per doc) and "Manual Ranges" (e.g., "1-2, 3, 4-5")
  - pdf.js v3.11.174 loaded lazily via CDN on first use
  - Fixed: CSP `blob:` for pdf.js worker, `.show` class for modal visibility, progressive thumbnail rendering
  - **Deployed:** API deployed, submodule pushed. Verified modal opens with 15-page PDF thumbnails.

### Test DL-237: PDF Split & Re-Classify
  - [x] Multi-page PDF (3+ pages) shows split banner on review card
  - [ ] Single-page PDF does NOT show split button
  - [x] Split modal opens with correct page thumbnails rendered via pdf.js (verified with 15-page PDF)
  - [ ] "Split All" mode creates one classification per page
  - [ ] "Manual Ranges" mode correctly parses "1-2, 3, 4-5" into groups
  - [ ] Invalid range input (e.g., "0, 99") shows validation error
  - [ ] Split PDFs are uploaded to OneDrive with `_part1`, `_part2` suffixes
  - [ ] Each split segment is classified independently (different template matches possible)
  - [ ] Original classification hidden after split (review_status = 'split')
  - [ ] New classification cards appear on refresh with correct client/report context
  - [ ] `split_from` field links children to parent in Airtable
  - [ ] `page_range` field shows correct ranges on child records
  - [ ] Verify no regression: approve/reject/reassign still work normally
  - [ ] Mobile: split modal is usable on small screens
  - [ ] New inbound multi-page PDF auto-populates `page_count` field
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/237-pdf-split-reclassify.md`

## Session Summary (2026-03-31)
- **DL-235:** OneDrive folder routing restructure
  - Renamed filing type folders: `דוחות שנתיים` → `דוח שנתי`, `הצהרות הון` → `הצהרת הון` (singular)
  - Moved `ארכיון` from inside filing type folders to year level (sibling of filing types)
  - Fixed `moveFileToArchive()`: 3-level parent traversal instead of 2
  - Fixed main review handler: split archive (3 levels up) vs זוהו (2 levels up, stays inside filing type)
  - 2 files changed: `attachment-utils.ts`, `classifications.ts`
  - **Needs deploy:** `wrangler deploy` to activate

### Test DL-235: OneDrive Folder Routing Restructure
  - [ ] Reject a classification → file moves to `{year}/ארכיון/` (NOT inside filing type folder)
  - [ ] Approve with override → old file moves to `{year}/ארכיון/`
  - [ ] Reassign unmatched doc → file moves to `{year}/דוח שנתי/זוהו/` (still inside filing type)
  - [ ] Inbound email attachment → uploads to `{year}/דוח שנתי/זוהו/` or `ממתינים לזיהוי/` (singular folder name)
  - [ ] Admin upload from doc manager → goes to `{year}/דוח שנתי/מסמכים שזוהו/` (singular)
  - [ ] CS document → uploads to `{year}/הצהרת הון/` (singular, not plural)
  - [ ] Existing files in old plural folders still accessible (no migration, old URLs unchanged)
  - [ ] Regression: approve standard (no conflict) → file renamed in place, no folder move
  - [ ] Regression: reassign matched doc → file renamed, stays in current folder
  - [ ] Regression: keep_both → new doc created, no archive move
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/documents/235-onedrive-folder-routing-restructure.md`

Previous (same day):
- **DL-222 (addendum):** Fixed client switcher in document-manager — was navigating with `report_id` instead of `client_id`, causing "Not Started" screen. 10 edits in switcher section, no backend changes. Tested & confirmed working.

- **DL-234:** Skip own outbound emails in inbound pipeline
  - Added `SYSTEM_SENDER` filter in `processor.ts` to skip emails from `reports@moshe-atsits.co.il`
  - Prevents system-generated emails from being added as client messages/notes
  - 4-line change, follows existing auto-reply filter pattern
  - Cleaned up 7 system-generated notes from Client Name test account
  - **Needs deploy:** `wrangler deploy` to activate the filter

### Test DL-234: Skip Own Outbound Emails
  - [ ] Send test email FROM reports@moshe-atsits.co.il → verify pipeline skips (Worker logs)
  - [ ] Send test email FROM real client → verify normal processing
  - [ ] Send test from another @moshe-atsits.co.il address → verify office forwarding still works
  - [ ] Trigger a reminder → verify reminder works AND inbox copy is skipped
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/234-skip-own-outbound-emails.md`

- **DL-232:** Complete email & print filing type audit + fix
  - Audited all 9 email types + questionnaire print for AR/CS differentiation
  - Fixed Client Doc Request "has docs" case: subject + body now include filing type (Workers `email-html.ts`)
  - Fixed Type A reminder: header + 3 body paragraphs now dynamic (n8n WF[06])
  - Fixed Type B reminder: EN + HE body text now dynamic (n8n WF[06])
  - Fixed WhatsApp pre-filled text: generic across all emails (`email-styles.ts` + n8n nodes)
  - Fixed questionnaire print: title now "Name — Filing Type Year", meta shows "שאלון הוגש"
  - Applied print fixes to both admin `script.js` and `document-manager.js`
  - Fixed duplicate `reportClient` variable crash in print function
  - Corrected DL-222's assessment that Type A/B reminders were "DUAL" (only subjects were)
  - Deployed Workers + updated n8n WF[06] + pushed GitHub Pages

Previous session (same day):
- **DL-231:** Fix keep_both classification paths missing `document_key`, `document_uid`, `issuer_key`

Previous session (2026-03-30):

## Session Summary (2026-03-30)
- **DL-228:** Smart add second filing type — 4 features:
  1. Email blur auto-detect: typing an existing client's email shows inline banner with pre-fill option
  2. Row menu shortcut: "הוסף הצהרת הון/דוח שנתי" in dashboard table "..." menu (desktop, mobile, right-click)
  3. Doc manager button: "Add other type" next to filing tabs, calls import endpoint + page reload
  4. Tab linking: `viewClientDocs()` passes `&tab=filing_type` → doc manager opens correct tab
  - API: `client-reports.ts` now returns `client_email`/`cc_email` in office mode
  - CSS: `.existing-client-banner` (slide-down), `.field-prefilled` (yellow tint), `.add-filing-type-btn` (dashed blue)
