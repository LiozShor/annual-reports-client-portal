## Session Summary (2026-04-17 — DL-299 PA card doc-manager parity)

### DL-299: PA Card — Per-Doc Issuer Edit + Note Popover + Print [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]

Three doc-manager features ported onto the DL-298 PA card so admins don't need to leave for common edits:

1. **Per-doc manual issuer edit.** Pencil icon inline on each doc row (hover-reveal desktop, always-on mobile) → inline input + ✓/✗. For T501/T401/T301 an extra "החלף חברה ▼" combobox lists known `company_links` with live filter. Saves via `EDIT_DOCUMENTS.name_updates` (same path as DL-296 ✨ accept). Complements the ✨ suggestion for wrong/missing cases.
2. **Per-doc bookkeepers_notes popover.** Speech-bubble icon per row; filled when note has content. Popover flip-above near viewport bottom; immediate save on outside-click / blur via `EDIT_DOCUMENTS.note_updates`; Esc cancels. Rollback on failure.
3. **Questionnaire print.** 🖨 הדפסה button in the Q&A section title. Shared `printQuestionnaireSheet(data)` helper in new `frontend/shared/print-questionnaire.js`. Doc-manager's print fn refactored to a thin wrapper around the same helper.

**Backend:** `admin-pending-approval.ts` now returns `company_links` (name→url). `EDIT_DOCUMENTS` already accepted `note_updates[]` — no route change.

**Files changed:**
```
api/src/routes/admin-pending-approval.ts            # return company_links
frontend/shared/print-questionnaire.js              # NEW — shared print helper
frontend/admin/index.html                           # +<script> for print helper; +#paNotePopover DOM
frontend/document-manager.html                      # +<script> for print helper
frontend/assets/js/document-manager.js              # printQuestionnaireFromDocManager → thin wrapper
frontend/admin/js/script.js                         # pencil + note buttons in renderPaDocTagRow; 10+ PA handlers; print button in Q&A section title
frontend/admin/css/style.css                        # .pa-doc-row__edit/note, .pa-issuer-edit-row, .pa-issuer-swap-combo, .pa-note-popover, .pa-print-btn
.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/299-pa-card-issuer-edit-notes-print.md  # design log
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md                         # DL-299 row

## Previous Session Summary (2026-04-17 — DL-298 PA queue stacked cards)

### DL-298: PA Queue — Stacked Full-Width Cards with Internal Q&A | Docs Split [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]

Full redesign of the "סקירה ואישור" tab. Replaces DL-292's master/preview split with a stacked column of full-width client cards; each card internally splits Q&A (left) and required docs (right) at ≥1024px. First 3 cards (FIFO-oldest) auto-expanded on load; the rest render as informative collapsed headers (name, id, age badge, count pills for answers / docs / ✨ / questions / notes, a folder-open doc-manager link matching AI-Review accordions, and a chevron). DL-296's ✨ issuer-name suggestion moved from a floating card-level band to an inline chip at the end of each doc row — 1 click accepts. Client Questions modal unchanged. Approve & Send unchanged. Preview panel + `loadPaPreview` / `loadPaMobilePreview` / `buildPaPreviewHtml` / `_activePaReportId` / mobile preview modal all deleted. **DL-295 "docs column empty in preview" bug is now moot — the preview panel no longer exists.**

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/admin/index.html                                   # PA tab: .ai-review-split → #paCardsContainer.pa-stack; removed paMobilePreviewModal
frontend/admin/js/script.js                                 # buildPaCard rewrite (header + optional body); togglePaCard; _paExpanded Set; inline ✨ chip inside renderPaDocTagRow; deleted 5 preview fns
frontend/admin/css/style.css                                # .pa-stack, .pa-card--stack/collapsed/expanded, .pa-card__body fade-in, .pa-count-badge, .pa-card__chevron, .pa-doc-row__suggest; removed stale #paReviewDetail mobile rule
.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/298-pa-queue-stacked-cards.md   # this log
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md                                 # DL-298 row
```

**No backend changes.** DL-292 endpoint already returns all needed fields; DL-296 populates `issuer_name_suggested` as before.

## Active TODOs

1. **Test DL-299: PA card doc-manager parity** — verify the three new features on the live site.
   - [ ] Pencil appears on hover (desktop) / always (mobile) at the end of each doc row
   - [ ] Click pencil on T106 (non-company) → input + ✓/✗ only, no swap toggle
   - [ ] Click pencil on T501/T401/T301 → input + ✓/✗ + "החלף חברה ▼" toggle
   - [ ] Toggle swap → filtered combobox lists `company_links`; pick one → input filled; ✓ → saves
   - [ ] Enter saves; Esc / ✗ cancels with original value restored
   - [ ] Save updates doc name, clears any ✨ chip on that row, toast "שם עודכן", Airtable PATCHed
   - [ ] Save failure (network offline) → rollback + error toast
   - [ ] Click note icon → popover anchored to icon (flip-above near viewport bottom)
   - [ ] Edit text + outside-click → icon swaps to filled (`message-square-text`), toast "הערה נשמרה", Airtable PATCHed
   - [ ] Esc in popover → closes without saving; no toast
   - [ ] Opening second note popover closes the first
   - [ ] Print button visible in "תשובות שאלון" title; click → new window with Q&A + client questions + office notes; popup blocker → toast
   - [ ] Doc-manager's print button still works identically (refactor didn't break it)
   - [ ] DL-298 expand/collapse, DL-296 ✨ accept, DL-227 status menu, DL-295 hide-No toggle, folder-open link all unchanged
   - [ ] RTL + Hebrew characters render correctly in print window
   - [ ] No console errors

   Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/299-pa-card-issuer-edit-notes-print.md`

2. **Test DL-298: PA Queue stacked cards** — verify the stacked layout + expand/collapse + inline ✨ + doc-manager link on the live site.
   - [ ] Open "סקירה ואישור" tab → no sticky preview panel exists; single stacked column of cards
   - [ ] First 3 cards expanded on load; rest collapsed with informative header (name, id, date, priority badge, count badges, folder-open doc-manager link)
   - [ ] Expanded card at ≥1024px: Q&A on one side, docs on the other side, 50/50
   - [ ] Expanded card at <1024px: Q&A and docs stack vertically
   - [ ] Click collapsed card header → expands inline with fade-in; chevron rotates
   - [ ] Click expanded card header → collapses back
   - [ ] Click folder-open icon in header → opens `document-manager.html?client_id=<id>` in a new tab; does NOT toggle expand/collapse state
   - [ ] Card with ≥1 ✨ suggestion → ✨ chip renders INLINE in the matching doc row (right after the doc name), not in a floating band
   - [ ] Click ✨ chip → optimistic UI removes chip, doc name updates, toast shown, Airtable PATCHed (DL-296 behavior preserved)
   - [ ] Inline doc status menu (DL-227 pattern via `renderPaDocTagRow`) still works inside the card
   - [ ] "שאל את הלקוח" modal still opens from card actions footer (DL-292 behavior preserved)
   - [ ] Approve & Send → card slides out → toast "נשלח ל…" → stage advances; queue re-renders minus that card
   - [ ] Empty state "כל השאלונים נסקרו" renders when no items
   - [ ] Pagination (50/page) renders below the stack
   - [ ] Year + filing-type filters still work
   - [ ] AI-Review tab visually unchanged (no CSS regression)
   - [ ] Doc-manager, dashboard, reminders tabs unchanged
   - [ ] Mobile (390px): cards stack full-width, body sections stack, ✨ chip still inline, actions footer full-width
   - [ ] RTL: chevron rotates the correct direction; inline ✨ chip sits at the end of the doc name (logical, not left)
   - [ ] No console errors; no dangling references to `paPreview*` DOM ids or `_activePaReportId`

   Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/298-pa-queue-stacked-cards.md`

## Archived Sessions

### 2026-04-17 — DL-295 (superseded by DL-298)

DL-295 shipped 2-col preview + placeholder fix + priority + inline actions. The preview panel it redesigned has been removed by DL-298; the "docs column empty in preview" bug noted at the top of the previous current-status is no longer reachable. DL-295's backend `doc_chips` flattening + `.pa-doc-tag-clickable` + priority CSS + inline status menu are still in use inside the new stacked cards.

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-17 — DL-295 PA queue improvements)

### DL-295: PA Queue Improvements — 2-col preview + placeholder fix + priority + inline actions [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]

Builds on DL-294. Four improvements:

1. **2-column preview layout.** Q&A left / Docs right at ≥1024px via `.pa-preview-cols` CSS grid; stacks to single column below. Notes + Questions remain full-width below the grid; sticky footer unchanged.
2. **`{placeholder}` leak fixed.** Master card chips no longer show raw template tokens like `{city_name}`, `{company_name}`, `{deposit_type}`. Backend flattens `doc_chips[]` from the already-resolved `doc_groups[]` (single source of truth); templates' unresolved `short_name_he` no longer leaks to chips.
3. **Priority age badges.** Master cards show `N ימים` pill: red >7 days, yellow 3–7 days, none <3.
4. **Inline doc status menu in preview.** Click a doc name → popover with Missing/Received/Requires_Fix/Waived → optimistic UI + `EDIT_DOCUMENTS` API (`send_email: false`). Reuses DL-227's `.ai-doc-tag-menu` DOM + CSS; new PA-scoped callback (`renderPaDocTagRow` / `openPaDocTagMenu` / `updatePaDocStatusInline`). On failure: rollback + error toast.

**Files changed:**
```
api/src/routes/admin-pending-approval.ts                  # flatten doc_chips from doc_groups
frontend/admin/js/script.js                               # buildPaCard priority + resolved names; 2-col buildPaPreviewBody; inline doc menu (5 new functions)
frontend/admin/css/style.css                              # .pa-preview-cols, .pa-card__priority--{med,high}, .pa-doc-tag-clickable
.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/295-pa-queue-improvements.md  # design log
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md                               # DL-295 row
```

**Test checklist (DL-295):**
- [ ] Master card chips: no raw `{xxx}` tokens visible for any report (verify specifically on CPA-XXX & CPA-XXX from screenshot)
- [ ] Chip renders bolded issuer (no literal `<b>` text visible)
- [ ] Desktop (≥1024px): preview shows Q&A left / Docs right; Notes + Questions full-width below
- [ ] Tablet/mobile (<1024px): sections stack vertically in order
- [ ] Age badge: red `N ימים` when >7d, yellow 3–7d, none <3d
- [ ] Click doc name in preview → status menu opens anchored to the tag
- [ ] Select "לא נדרש" (Waived) → toast confirms, doc row re-renders waived, master card chip updates, Airtable `status` PATCHed
- [ ] Select "דרוש תיקון" / "התקבל" / "חסר" → same flow, no email sent
- [ ] Network failure (DevTools offline) → optimistic rollback + error toast
- [ ] Menu closes on outside click; Esc closes menu
- [ ] DL-294 sticky footer still sticks; stats strip counts correct
- [ ] AI-Review tab inline doc-tag menu unchanged (no regression)
- [ ] XSS: inject `<script>` into test issuer → whitelist escapes
- [ ] Mobile sheet (`loadPaMobilePreview`) renders stacked layout without breaking

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-17 morning (Session — DL-293 doc-manager edit + DL-297 sticky header & editable stage — shipped)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-17 morning — DL-293 + DL-297 doc-manager polish)

### DL-293: Doc-Manager — Full Client Edit (Pencil + Inline) [SHIPPED — NEED TESTING]
- New shared module `frontend/assets/js/client-detail-modal.js` — extracts DL-106 modal logic from `admin/js/script.js` so both dashboard and doc-manager reuse one implementation via `openClientDetailModalShared(reportId, {authToken, toast, onSaved})`.
- Doc-manager client bar: pencil next to client name opens the modal; email/cc_email/phone rendered as `.editable-field <strong>` with click-to-edit (Enter/Esc/blur semantics, LTR inputs in RTL page, validation on email fields).
- API `api/src/routes/client-reports.ts` office-mode response now returns `client_phone` alongside existing `client_email` + `cc_email`.
- Dashboard modal (DL-106 + DL-268 dirty-check + change-summary) preserved byte-identical via onSaved callback.
- Follow-up fixes in the same session:
  - `cf9ad79` — pencil visibility was gated on `REPORT_ID`; moved `updateClientBarContacts()` after REPORT_ID resolves + re-run `lucide.createIcons()` so the SVG glyph paints when revealed.

### DL-297: Doc-Manager — Sticky Header Merge + Editable Stage [SHIPPED — NEED TESTING]
- Sticky action bar moved out of `#content` to be a sibling of `.page-wrapper` at the top of `<body>` (needed because `.container { overflow: hidden }` in `common.css` was clipping `position: sticky` children). Switched from `position: fixed` → `position: sticky; top: 0`; dropped the 44px spacer compensation.
- `שלב` (stage) label in the client bar is now clickable → dropdown with all 8 stages (current highlighted via `.stage-option.current`). Reuses existing `ADMIN_CHANGE_STAGE` endpoint; optimistic update + revert on error; Esc / outside-click close.
- Originally DL-295; renumbered to DL-297 after parallel-session merge collision (your other tab shipped DL-295 = PA queue improvements and DL-296 = WF02 extract-issuer-names during this session).

### Worker deploy
- `annual-reports-api` deployed with `client_phone` response field — Version `08408189-1ff1-4701-a53f-d16cccfca2e1`.

### Follow-ups / gotchas learned
- **`position: sticky` inside `.container`** → clipped by `overflow:hidden`. For any future sticky bars on pages that use `.container`, put the sticky element OUTSIDE `.container`.
- **Auto-merge to main was overridden** — saved to memory (`feedback_ask_before_merge_push.md`): the design-log skill's Phase-D auto-merge step is superseded by the standing "ask before merge and push" rule.

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 late night — DL-294 PA queue redesign)

### DL-294: PA Queue Preview Panel Redesign + Bold Issuer Rendering [SHIPPED — NEED TESTING]

Builds on DL-292. Three defects fixed:

1. **Raw `<b>` tags visible as text** → now rendered as bold via `renderDocLabel()` (XSS-safe whitelist: escape everything, then un-escape only `<b>`/`</b>`).
2. **Short names missing, doc names overloaded** → backend now returns split shape: `doc_chips[]` (flat — template `short_name_he` + raw `issuer_name` HTML) and `doc_groups[]` (per-person/per-category via `groupDocsByPerson` + `formatForOfficeMode`).
3. **Preview panel looked amateurish** → redesigned with:
   - Sticky client-summary header (name + id + filing/year/relative-date) with stats strip (📝 answers · 📂 docs · 💬 notes · ❓ questions)
   - Scrollable middle: Q&A grouped into "✓ כן" chips grid / free-text rows / collapsible "✗ לא" toggle; docs tree grouped per-person/per-category with bolded issuer names
   - Sticky footer with "שאל את הלקוח" + "אשר ושלח ללקוח" CTAs (always reachable)
   - Notes highlighted with brand accent border
   - Per-person section header with emoji, category sub-groups

**Files changed:**
```
api/src/routes/admin-pending-approval.ts   # returns doc_chips + doc_groups; removes cleanDocName
frontend/admin/js/script.js                # buildPaCard + buildPaPreviewHtml rewritten; togglePaShowNo added
frontend/admin/css/style.css               # .pa-preview-header/-stats/-sticky-footer/-person-section/etc
frontend/admin/index.html                  # #paPreviewBody: inline style → .pa-preview-body class
.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/294-*.md       # design log
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md                # DL-294 row
```

**Branch hygiene note:** Discovered mid-session that original DL-292 worktree was orphaned (filesystem dir existed but no longer a registered git worktree). Branched off main directly as `DL-294-pa-queue-redesign` (rename from DL-293 to avoid collision with another tab's `DL-293-doc-manager-edit-client`). Merged and cleaned up.

**Test checklist (DL-294):**
- [ ] Chip on master card shows bolded issuer (e.g., "טופס 106 – **יובל חינוך**") not literal `<b>יובל חינוך</b>`
- [ ] Chip truncates with "…" tooltip shows full text
- [ ] Preview header shows client name + client_id + filing_type + year + relative submitted date
- [ ] Stats strip: 📝 answers · 📂 docs · 💬 notes · ❓ questions with correct counts
- [ ] Q&A "✓ כן" section renders as chips grid (dense, compact)
- [ ] Q&A "תשובות פתוחות" section renders as label/value rows
- [ ] "הצג תשובות לא (N)" toggle expands/collapses negative answers
- [ ] Docs grouped per-person (client first, spouse below) with `📂 מסמכים של {name}` header
- [ ] Within each person, categories grouped with emoji + name_he; status pill on each row
- [ ] Issuer name bolded via `renderDocLabel`; no literal `<b>` visible
- [ ] Spouse-only reports render correctly (no empty client section)
- [ ] Approve button sticks to bottom of preview, always visible while scrolling
- [ ] Questions button opens existing modal (unchanged)
- [ ] Empty state renders without glitch
- [ ] Mobile (390px): preview modal renders with the new layout inside
- [ ] XSS: inject `<script>` into an issuer_name — confirm whitelist escapes it
- [ ] No regression: AI-Review tab unchanged; doc-manager approve flow unchanged; DL-092 duplicate-send guard fires

Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/294-pa-queue-redesign.md`
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-17 (DL-296 WF02 issuer-name extraction deployed)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-17 — DL-296 WF02 issuer-name extraction)

### DL-296: WF02 issuer-name extraction + 1-click accept on Review & Approve queue [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
**Numbering note:** shipped on branch `DL-293-wf02-extract-issuer-names` while DL-293 was unassigned; renumbered at merge time after `admin-ui/293-doc-manager-edit-client` landed on main in parallel. In-flight artifacts (n8n node IDs, commit messages, code comments) keep the DL-293 label for traceability.

Haiku 4.5 extracts entity names (employer, broker, bank) from questionnaire free-text stuffed in `issuer_name` (e.g., "עבדתי בבר בתל אביב שנקרא ג'ויה" → `ג'ויה`). Extraction runs during WF02, writes to a new `issuer_name_suggested` field (admin-only). Review & Approve queue card shows a bold ✨ chip per suggestion; 1-click accept promotes to `issuer_name`. Original context preserved in `bookkeepers_notes`. Suppresses no-op suggestions (suggestion literally equal to existing issuer_name).

**Production state applied this session:**
- Airtable: added `issuer_name_suggested` on Documents table (`flduGQ8NvmTVEN8Ik`).
- Worker deployed: `annual-reports-api` → version `292e9c32-c882-48d6-b124-a963998cb793` (adds `POST /webhook/extract-issuer-names`).
- WF02 (`QqEIWQlRs1oZzEtNxFUcQ`) patched via REST API (scripts/dl293-patch-wf02.py): `Build Issuer Extraction Payload` (Code) + `Call Extract Issuer Names` (HTTP, Continue-on-Fail) inserted after `Upsert Documents`; workflow active. Side-effect: `availableInMCP` flipped to False (n8n public-API PUT whitelist).
- Smoke test: endpoint auth works (401 without bearer, 200 empty with `N8N_INTERNAL_KEY`).

**Test checklist (move to Active TODOs):**
- [ ] Submit a live Tally questionnaire with a known context ("עובד בחברת אינטראקטיב") — verify `issuer_name_suggested` lands in Airtable for the matching T867 doc, `bookkeepers_notes` has `[תשובה מהשאלון] ...`, and `issuer_name` is unchanged.
- [ ] Open that report on the Review & Approve queue — verify the bold ✨ chip renders, click → toast, doc chip label updates, `issuer_name_suggested` cleared server-side.
- [ ] "אשר הכל" link appears when a card has 2+ suggestions — batch accept works.
- [ ] Manual inline-rename (DL-080) on a doc with a pending suggestion also clears `issuer_name_suggested` (EDIT_DOCUMENTS name_updates path).
- [ ] No-op suppression: contrive a case where issuer_name is already clean ("לאומי") → no chip surfaces.
- [ ] Real cleanup suggestion: `issuer_name = "בלאומי"` → chip offers "לאומי", click accepts.
- [ ] Low-confidence path: questionnaire context without a named entity ("עבדתי 3 חודשים במפעל") → no chip, `bookkeepers_notes` still gets raw context.
- [ ] Failure path: temporarily block ANTHROPIC_API_KEY → WF02 still completes (Continue-on-Fail); office receives email as today.
- [ ] Approve-and-Send on a report with accepted suggestions — client email renders compact issuer labels instead of full sentences.
- [ ] Re-enable `availableInMCP: true` on WF02 in n8n UI (restore MCP read access).

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 night — DL-292 Review & Approve queue tab)

### DL-292: Review & Approve Queue Tab [SHIPPED — NEED TESTING]

New "סקירה ואישור" top-nav tab that eliminates the DL-291 W-1 P1 scroll friction (55 viewport-heights per session → 0). Split-view layout (master cards + sticky preview) mirroring AI-Review.

**Backend:**
- `GET /webhook/admin-pending-approval?year=&filing_type=` — single round-trip returning all stage-3 (`Pending_Approval`) reports enriched with questionnaire answers (negative "✗ לא" pre-filtered), doc chips (short_name_he + category emoji + status), notes, client_questions JSON, prior-year placeholder. FIFO-sorted by questionnaire submission date.
- Registered in `api/src/index.ts`.

**Frontend:**
- New tab button + badge (`#pendingApprovalTabBadge`) between "מוכנים להכנה" and "סקירת AI"
- Split view: master cards + sticky `#paReviewDetail` preview panel (same pattern as AI-Review)
- Card shows: client name + id + relative date, answer chips (first 4 + overflow), doc chips (first 6 + overflow), notes preview, prior-year placeholder "—", "שאל את הלקוח" outlined button + "אשר ושלח" green button
- Preview panel: full Q&A, full doc list grouped by category, full notes, questions list
- Approve → `.pa-card--sending` slide-out animation → `showAIToast` → auto-focus next card
- Questions modal (`#paQuestionsModal`): add/edit/delete; saves via `EDIT_DOCUMENTS`; badge counter updates inline
- Stage-3 stat card click now switches to this tab (previously only `toggleStageFilter('3')`)
- Mobile: cards stack, preview panel hidden; mobile preview modal (`#paMobilePreviewModal`)
- SWR caching, refresh button, background refresh — same pattern as AI-Review
- Mobile "עוד" bottom-nav popover entry

**Files changed:**
```
api/src/routes/admin-pending-approval.ts   # new endpoint
api/src/index.ts                           # register route
frontend/shared/endpoints.js               # ADMIN_PENDING_APPROVAL constant
frontend/admin/index.html                  # tab button, tab content, modals, mobile nav
frontend/admin/js/script.js                # full PA queue section (~400 lines)
frontend/admin/css/style.css               # .pa-* styles + slide-out animation
.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/292-*.md       # design log
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md                # DL-292 row added
```

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Tab "סקירה ואישור" visible in top nav with loading badge → resolves to count
- [ ] Badge matches stage-3 stat card count
- [ ] Cards list stage-3 only, oldest first
- [ ] Card chips: no "✗ לא" answers appear; doc chips show correct names
- [ ] Click card → preview panel shows full Q&A + docs + notes
- [ ] "שאל את הלקוח" → modal opens → add/edit/delete question → save → badge updates
- [ ] "אשר ושלח" → confirm dialog → slide-out → toast "נשלח ל..." → next card focuses → Airtable stage = Collecting_Docs
- [ ] Empty state shows when no stage-3 reports
- [ ] Stage-3 stat card click → switches to this tab
- [ ] Mobile (390px): cards stack, preview hidden, mobile modal works
- [ ] Year / filing-type filters work
- [ ] No regression: AI-Review, document-manager, stage-3 bounce animation

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 evening — DL-289 merge + bugfixes)

### DL-289: Recent Messages — expand-compose modal + preview perf [SHIPPED]

**Bug fix 1 — modal not opening:**
- `.ai-modal-overlay` is `display:none` by default; the code was appending the overlay to `<body>` but never adding `.show`. Fixed: `requestAnimationFrame(() => overlay.classList.add('show'))` after `appendChild`.

**Bug fix 2 — preview slow on first run:**
- `/admin-comment-preview` did an Airtable `getRecord` on every debounced keypress to resolve `client_name` + `year`. Fixed: `renderMessages` now writes `data-client-name` + `data-year` onto each `.msg-row`; `showReplyInput` reads them and passes to `expandReplyCompose`; frontend includes them in the POST body; backend skips the Airtable lookup entirely when both are present. Preview is now pure CPU (template render only).

**Also:** Merged `DL-288-recent-messages-checkmark-thread` branch into `main` (conflict in `INDEX.md` — our log renumbered 288→289 since another session claimed 288 for the queued-subtitle stale-flash fix). Remote branch deleted.

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/admin/js/script.js    # .show class on overlay; clientName/year data attrs + threaded params
api/src/routes/dashboard.ts    # fast path: skip Airtable when client_name+year in body
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md    # conflict resolved — DL-289 row added
.agent/current-status.md       # this block
```

**Test checklist (DL-289 remaining):**
- [ ] Expand modal opens on click
- [ ] Type in expanded textarea → preview updates within ~400ms (fast, no visible stall)
- [ ] Escape key + overlay click = collapse (preserves text)
- [ ] Click collapse → compact textarea has the typed text
- [ ] Click send from expanded mode → email sent, post-reply prompt appears
- [ ] No regression: ✓ mark-as-handled, thread stacking, post-reply prompt all still work

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 afternoon — DL-280 v2)

### DL-280 v2: Mobile Bottom Nav Root Fix (Class-Based FOUC Gate) [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Mobile bottom nav still hidden after login despite DL-280's morning fix. DL-281's merge (`81a1b36`) silently overwrote DL-280's three-line `_showAppUI()` fix because DL-281 was branched off main before DL-280 merged. The JS fix had no compile-time defense against stale-branch merges.
- **Root cause (structural):** v1 mixed CSS layers — inline `style="display:none"` (specificity 1000) + `.visible` class rule (specificity ~20) — making the JS-side `bn.style.display = ''` line load-bearing. Lose that line, lose the fix.
- **v2 Fix (structural):** Replace inline `style="display:none"` with `class="fouc-hidden"`. Class-based gate keeps the FOUC defense in CSS (where it composes safely with `.visible`) instead of HTML inline (where it specificity-fights). `.bottom-nav.visible:not(.fouc-hidden)` is a fail-safe — if JS forgets to remove `.fouc-hidden`, nav stays hidden (safe default).
- **Why it survives merges:** (1) `fouc-hidden` is a unique grep-able token; any merge that drops it from HTML is visually obvious in code review. (2) `:not()` fail-safe means missing the JS class swap can't cause UI breakage. (3) `_showAppUI` does the obvious thing (remove hide class, add show class) — no magic future devs would dismiss.
- **Bonus — chat widget migration:** Per DL-257 note, chat widget used the same fragile `.app.visible ~ #chatWidget` sibling-combinator pattern. Migrated to `#chatWidget.visible` class for consistency. Wired into `_showAppUI` and `pageshow` symmetric reset.
- **Scrolling concern:** User asked nav must stay visible during scroll. Auto-handled by existing `position: fixed; bottom: 0` + verified no transform/filter parent that would break fixed positioning.
- **Files:**
  - `frontend/admin/index.html` — `<nav class="bottom-nav fouc-hidden">` (was: inline `style="display:none"`)
  - `frontend/admin/css/style.css` — `.bottom-nav.fouc-hidden { display: none; }` rule + `:not(.fouc-hidden)` guard on `.visible`. Chat widget: `#chatWidget.visible` replaces sibling combinator.
  - `frontend/admin/js/script.js` — `_showAppUI`: swap fouc-hidden → visible for both bottomNav + chatWidget. `pageshow`: symmetric inverse.
- **Design log:** `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/280-fix-mobile-bottom-nav-hidden.md` (Section 9 added — v2 root fix)
- **Branch:** `DL-280-root-fix`

**Test checklist (DL-280 v2) — see Active TODOs below.**

## FINDING A JOB

**Context:** Lioz has no prior professional experience. This project is the portfolio candidate, but it was AI-assisted ("vibe coded") — so ownership ≠ understanding yet. Goal: turn this repo into a defensible junior-dev portfolio.

### Skill gaps to fill (prioritized)
1. **SQL** — joins, GROUP BY, window functions. ~1 week.
2. **React** — current frontend is vanilla HTML/JS; most junior postings require React. 2–4 weeks.
3. **Docker** — `Dockerfile`, `docker compose`, running containers. 2–3 days.
4. **One major cloud (AWS or GCP)** — CF Workers is cousin but recruiters filter for AWS/GCP. Learn S3, Lambda, IAM. 1–2 weeks.
5. **DSA basics** — arrays, hashmaps, recursion for interview screens. LeetCode easy/medium.

**Skip for now** (unless a specific job asks): BigQuery, Angular, Kafka, Kubernetes, big-data stacks.

### Owning this project (so it's defensible in interviews)
- Pick 3–4 subsystems, read them line-by-line until every decision is explainable.
- Break things on purpose, fix without AI. ~10 reps.
- Rebuild one feature from scratch without AI (e.g., the inbound email queue). Ugly but yours.
- Write a README framing this as "production system handling X emails/day" — architecture-first.

### Interview-ready talking points for this repo
- **Cloudflare Workers vs Node/Express:** serverless/edge, V8 isolates (no `fs`/most npm), stateless, CPU-time limits. Chosen for cost, no server management, global latency, webhook fit.
- **Why a queue in front of the inbound webhook (DL-287):** avoid webhook timeouts (CF ~30s), prevent downstream 429 storms via controlled batch/concurrency, automatic retries + DLQ, decouple sender from processing time. `waitUntil` was tried (DL-283) and failed because its 30s cap can't absorb 60–72s `Retry-After` from 429s.
- **`max_batch_size=1`:** per-message CPU budget is heavy (classification + OneDrive upload); batching would starve the CPU limit — trade throughput for safety.

### Quiz progress (this session)
- [x] Q1 — Workers vs Node. Partial credit; corrected on runtime + execution model.
- [x] Q2 — Why a queue. Partial credit (got 429); expanded to timeout + retries + decoupling.
- [ ] Q3 — `max_batch_size=1` trade-off. Pending.
- [ ] Next topics to cover: dedup with KV (`message.attempts === 1`), HMAC client tokens (45d vs 24h assisted), Airtable `performUpsert` race pattern, n8n IF-node boolean gotcha, frontend stale-flash root cause (DL-288).

### Next concrete steps
- [ ] Finish the quiz on this repo (Q3 onward).
- [ ] Write portfolio README for this project (architecture diagram + 3 key decisions).
- [ ] Start SQL + React tracks in parallel.
- [ ] Build one tiny 100%-self-written side project (todo app with auth, deployed) to pair with this repo.

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — DL-288)

### DL-288: Fix Queued-Subtitle Stale Flash on Dashboard Load [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** On admin dashboard load, stage-3 card flashes `(30 בתור לשליחה)` subtitle for ~100–300ms, then disappears. Stale count from yesterday's already-delivered emails.
- **Root cause:** `recalculateStats()` in `frontend/admin/js/script.js:1598-1607` fell back to filtering `clientsData.c.queued_send_at` whenever `queuedEmailsLoaded === false`. That field never self-clears after 08:00 delivery (DL-273 §8 gap). DL-281 switched the post-load path to Outbox as source of truth but left this pre-load fallback alive (Risk C was never implemented).
- **Fix:** Replace the stale fallback with `: 0`. Subtitle renders only after `/admin-queued-emails` resolves.
- **Files:** `frontend/admin/js/script.js` (lines 1598-1603 — 10 lines → 6 lines)
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/288-queued-subtitle-no-stale-flash.md`

**Test checklist (DL-288) — see Active TODOs below.**

**Session note:** Originally planned to work in worktree `claude-session-20260416-145349`, but its git admin directory was pruned mid-session by a concurrent cleanup process. Branch work moved to main repo as `DL-288-queued-subtitle-no-stale-flash`.
### DL-288: Recent Messages — Comment Threads + Mark-as-Handled + Compose Expand & Preview [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]

- **Problem:** Three frictions in the dashboard side panel "הודעות אחרונות מלקוחות": (1) `replyMap.set()` in `dashboard.ts:198` overwrote prior office_reply for the same `reply_to`, so 2+ replies on a single client message collapsed to the last one; (2) trash icon framed the action as "delete clutter" instead of "I handled this" — wrong psychology for an inbox-style panel; (3) inline 2-row reply textarea was cramped, and the office sends real branded HTML emails without seeing how they'd look.
- **Fix:**
  - **Backend (`dashboard.ts`):** `repliesByOriginal: Map<string, Array<...>>` pushes instead of overwriting; sorted oldest-first per thread. New `POST /admin-comment-preview` route that calls existing `buildCommentEmailHtml` and returns rendered HTML + subject. No KV cache (debounced client-side).
  - **Frontend (`script.js`):** `renderMessages` loops `m.replies` array (numbered "תגובת המשרד #1/#2/..." when 2+); trash button replaced with green ✓ (`msg-action-btn--success` + `lucide="check"`); `markMessageHandled` calls existing `delete-client-note { mode:'hide' }` directly (no dialog); after successful reply, `showPostReplyPrompt` **appends** a strip below row content (NOT replace) with "סמן כטופל / השאר פתוח" + 8s auto-dismiss; `expandReplyCompose` opens `.ai-modal-overlay > .ai-modal-panel.msg-compose-modal` with 2-pane grid (textarea | iframe preview) and 400ms debounced preview fetch.
  - **CSS (`style.css`):** New `.msg-action-btn--success`, `.msg-thread-replies` (RTL connector via `border-right`), `.msg-reply-expand-btn`, `.msg-post-reply-prompt`, `.ai-modal-panel.msg-compose-modal` + grid + iframe + mobile @900px stacked.
  - **Endpoints (`endpoints.js`):** `ADMIN_COMMENT_PREVIEW` constant.
- **Process:** Subagent-driven development — Wave 1 dispatched 4 implementers in parallel (API/CSS/ENDPOINTS/JS) on disjoint files. Spec review (4×) → quality review (4×). User refinement mid-flow ("the mark as handled prompt will be inline") → re-dispatched JS for append-instead-of-replace. Quality review caught a memory leak (Escape listener only removed via Escape key) + an RTL bug (`right` vs `inset-inline-end`) — both fixed inline.
- **Design log:** `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/288-recent-messages-checkmark-thread.md`

**Files changed:**
```
api/src/routes/dashboard.ts                # replies array + new /admin-comment-preview
frontend/shared/endpoints.js               # +ADMIN_COMMENT_PREVIEW
frontend/admin/css/style.css               # +6 new rule blocks (DL-288 markers)
frontend/admin/js/script.js                # thread render, check btn, prompt, modal
.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/288-recent-messages-checkmark-thread.md (new)

.agent/current-status.md                   # this block
```

**Test Plan — DL-288 (NEED TESTING):**
N. **Test DL-288: Recent Messages Threads + Checkmark + Expand-Compose** — verify panel UX changes end-to-end on the live admin dashboard
   - [ ] Send 3 office replies on the same client message → all 3 appear stacked under the original, oldest-first, with thread connector line
   - [ ] Click ✓ button on a row → row fades out (300ms) + toast "סומן כטופל ✓"
   - [ ] Refresh page → handled message stays hidden (server `hidden_from_dashboard` flag persisted)
   - [ ] doc-manager timeline for the same client still shows the hidden message (no regression — DL-263 invariant)
   - [ ] After sending a reply: inline strip appears appended below row content (original message + new reply still visible) with "סמן כטופל / השאר פתוח" — auto-dismisses at 8s
   - [ ] Click "סמן כטופל" in post-reply strip → message hides
   - [ ] Click "השאר פתוח" or wait 8s → panel reloads, new reply visible in thread
   - [ ] Compact reply box: expand button visible top-right (RTL: visually on the left edge)
   - [ ] Click expand → modal opens, textarea preserves typed text
   - [ ] Type in expanded textarea → preview updates within ~400ms, shows logo, blue header bar, "שלום {name}", comment body, contact block, footer
   - [ ] Empty textarea → preview shows "הקלד הודעה לתצוגה מקדימה" placeholder, not stale HTML
   - [ ] Click collapse → modal closes, compact textarea has the typed text
   - [ ] Click send from expanded mode → email sent (or queued off-hours), same pipeline as compact, post-reply prompt appears
   - [ ] Mobile (<900px): expand modal stacks textarea above preview
   - [ ] Escape key + overlay click in modal = collapse (preserves text), NOT cancel
   - [ ] Open + close expand modal 5+ times → no Escape-listener leak (no duplicate Escape behaviour)
   - [ ] No regression: search bar, load-more, click-to-doc-manager all still work
   - [ ] No regression: trash icon fully gone — no orphan styles, no console errors

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — DL-287)

### DL-287: Cloudflare Queues Migration for Inbound Email Pipeline [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]

- **Problem:** Month-long whipsaw between sync (DL-286: n8n 120 s timeout kills Worker on multi-attachment 429-retry emails) and async `ctx.waitUntil` (DL-283: Cloudflare 30 s cap after response, DL-277's 60–72 s 429 `Retry-After` exceeds it → classifications dropped). Orit Matania (8 attachments) and Roby Haviv (multi-attachment) both stuck: `email_events` at `Detected`, `pending_classifications` = 0.
- **Fix:** Migrate producer to Cloudflare Queues. n8n → POST → auth + dedup-check + `INBOUND_QUEUE.send` + 202 (<2 s). Queue consumer gets fresh 5 min CPU budget per message, takes the dedup lock, runs unchanged `processInboundEmail`. Failures retry 3× with 30 s backoff, then DLQ → `logError(DEPENDENCY)` + admin email. Feature-flagged via `USE_QUEUE=true` secret for instant rollback.
- **Also:** `CLASSIFY_BATCH_SIZE = 3 → 1` (belt-and-suspenders — prevents 429 storms at source).
- **Research:** Cloudflare Queues docs, EIP "enqueue-then-return", DL-174 (async hybrid), DL-264 (rejected Queues for a different shape — not applicable here).
- **Design log:** `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/287-cloudflare-queues-inbound-email.md`

**Files changed:**
```
api/wrangler.toml                              # +queue producer + 2× consumer bindings
api/src/lib/types.ts                           # +INBOUND_QUEUE, +USE_QUEUE?, +InboundQueueMessage
api/src/lib/inbound/queue-consumer.ts  (new)   # handleInboundQueue
api/src/lib/inbound/dlq-consumer.ts    (new)   # handleInboundDLQ
api/src/routes/inbound-email.ts                # feature-flag branch; sync path preserved
api/src/index.ts                               # +queue(batch, env, ctx) export
api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts               # line 781: CLASSIFY_BATCH_SIZE 3→1
.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/287-cloudflare-queues-inbound-email.md (new)
.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md                    # +DL-287 row, DL-283 SUPERSEDED
.agent/current-status.md                       # this block
```

**Deploy steps (do in order — consumer FIRST, then flag):**
1. `cd api && npx wrangler deploy` — deploys consumer code (no-op without producer).
2. `npx wrangler queues create inbound-email`
3. `npx wrangler queues create inbound-email-dlq`
4. `npx wrangler secret put USE_QUEUE` → `true`
5. Verify V1–V4 below before recovering Orit + Roby.

**Test Plan — DL-287 (NEED TESTING):**
- [ ] **V1 — Producer fast path.** POST returns 202 in <2 s.
- [ ] **V2 — Consumer invocation.** Cloudflare tail shows `[queue] processing message_id=...` → `[queue] done ... status=completed`.
- [ ] **V3 — Idempotency.** Two enqueues of the same `message_id` → one PC record.
- [ ] **V4 — 1-attachment email.** PC + OneDrive upload <30 s.
- [ ] **V5 — 8-attachment email (Orit recovery).** 8 PC + 8 files in <2 min.
- [ ] **V6 — Roby recovery.** Roby's original → CPA-XXX/2025 folder.
- [ ] **V7 — 429 storm.** Force Anthropic rate-limit (admin re-classify 20 files). All classifications eventually land within Queue consumer's 5 min budget.
- [ ] **V8 — DLQ.** Poison message (bogus `message_id`) → 3 retries → DLQ → admin email <5 min.
- [ ] **V9 — Flag off.** `USE_QUEUE=false` → falls back to DL-286 sync path.
- [ ] **V10 — Regressions.** Forwarded email (DL-282), Office→PDF (Tier 2), office_reply (DL-266) all unchanged.

**Orit + Roby recovery (do AFTER V1–V4 pass):**
1. Delete `email_events/recmlZ8Op68OMbsAC` (Orit).
2. Delete `email_events/recRa6aWMSc92AiLJ` (Roby original).
3. Delete orphan PCs `rec3y6z3lhSt8QaPl` + `recSfYbYiI7wfJiqX` (Roby duplicates). Keep `rectTmGzXJgdJZwj4` (linked to Completed event).
4. Clear KV dedup keys: `dedup:<orit_message_id>`, `dedup:<roby_original_message_id>`.
5. User recovers both emails from Outlook deleted items (no need to ask clients to re-send).
6. Queue path processes them cleanly.

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — DL-284)

### DL-284: Admin "Fill Questionnaire on Behalf of Client" [IMPLEMENTED — Tally submission verification pending]
- **Problem:** Elderly clients can't fill the Tally questionnaire themselves. Office staff had no one-click way to reach a client's landing page from the admin dashboard; existing "View as Client" goes to the docs view, not the questionnaire.
- **Fix:** New right-click menu item on client rows for stages 1–2 (`Send_Questionnaire`, `Waiting_For_Answers`): "מלא שאלון במקום הלקוח". Mints a 24h client token (vs 45d for email links), opens landing page in a new tab with `?assisted=1` flag, landing renders a persistent yellow banner. Every issuance writes a `security_logs` INFO row (`event_type=ADMIN_ASSISTED_OPEN`) with admin IP + report_id + client_name.
- **Research:** Auth0 impersonation pattern, Google SRE tool-proxy, OWASP ASVS §V7. Actor ≠ subject separation via the audit log; fresh short-TTL token instead of reusing the client's 45d token; visible banner prevents forgotten assisted mode.
- **Files changed:** `api/src/routes/admin-assisted-link.ts` (new), `api/src/index.ts`, `frontend/shared/endpoints.js`, `frontend/assets/js/landing.js`, `frontend/assets/css/landing.css`, `frontend/admin/js/script.js`
- **Post-deploy fix (commit 4309b0b):** `logSecurity` was silently dropping rows for the new `ADMIN_ASSISTED_OPEN` event_type (Airtable single-select rejected unknown value; fire-and-forget `.catch()` swallowed it). Added optional `typecast` param to `AirtableClient.createRecords`; `logSecurity` now passes `typecast: true` so new event_types auto-create going forward.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/284-admin-questionnaire-link-on-behalf.md`

**Verified live (2026-04-16):** סלביק גרבר session — menu item appeared on `Waiting_For_Answers` client, confirm dialog shown, landing opened with yellow banner, language picker rendered beneath it, audit row landed in `security_logs` (after typecast fix).

**Remaining test — do next session:**
- [ ] Finish filling Slavic Gerber's Tally form → confirm Tally submission webhook (WF03) writes the answers to Airtable correctly (same as a real client submission)
- [ ] Verify a `Send_Questionnaire` client (not just `Waiting_For_Answers`) also works end-to-end
- [ ] Right-click on a stage ≥ 3 client → menu item should NOT appear (regression check)

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-16 (Session 14 — .agent reorg + urgent Airtable PAT rotation)
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-16 (DL-283 — n8n morning errors fix + PAT rotation runbook)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — DL-283)

### DL-283: n8n Workflow Errors Investigation & Fix [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Trigger:** This morning (2026-04-16 05:00–06:30 UTC) the n8n executions tab showed 4 errors across WF02 (×2, Airtable 401), WF05 (×1, 120s Worker timeout), WF06 (×1, Airtable 401 on 08:00 cron).
- **Root cause A — WF02/WF06:** Yesterday's PAT rotation (Session 14) updated the hardcoded token in WF02's `Clear Reminder Date` Code node but **missed the shared n8n Airtable credential `ODW07LgvsPQySQxh`**. 28 Airtable nodes across 6 workflows all reference this credential, so every Airtable call was 401'ing.
- **Root cause B — WF05:** Synchronous `processInboundEmail` in `api/src/routes/inbound-email.ts` awaits all attachment work before responding. For 19-PDF emails the work exceeded n8n's 120s HTTP cap, so n8n aborted and Cloudflare cancelled the Worker mid-flight.

**Actions taken**
- **Credential fix:** `PATCH /api/v1/credentials/ODW07LgvsPQySQxh` via n8n REST API (required `allowedHttpRequestDomains: "all"` in body alongside `accessToken`). Updated at 06:43:02 UTC.
- **Replay lost WF02 work:** triggered `/webhook/questionnaire-response` for both failed records — `recrpTM7Mi9eIP2us` (exec 11933 SUCCESS) and `reccuB0IJJkLHISRr` (exec 11936 SUCCESS).
- **Async inbound:** wrapped `processInboundEmail` in `c.executionCtx.waitUntil(...)`, return `202 accepted` immediately. Worker deployed: version `006deee5-8da2-4c78-8110-1249ca254871`. Post-deploy WF05 execs 11935 / 11938 both succeed.
- **Full audit:** scanned all 10 active workflows via REST API. Confirmed all 28 Airtable nodes use the shared credential (single PATCH fixed every one). **0 occurrences** of the old rotated PAT anywhere. 1 known-good hardcoded new-PAT (Session 14 workaround in `Clear Reminder Date`) left in place.
- **Runbook:** wrote `.agent/runbooks/pat-rotation.md` — 6-surface checklist covering Airtable regenerate, `.env`, Worker secret, n8n credential, grep for leaked tokens in design logs, grep Code/HTTP nodes for hardcoded copies.
- **Known remaining miss:** **WF06 08:00 Israel cron did not run** (exec 11925 failed before credential fix). Next scheduled cron is 2026-04-17 08:00 Israel. **User must manually execute WF06 via n8n UI ("Execute Workflow" button) to catch up today's reminders.**

**WF05 follow-up (out of scope for DL-283):** `ctx.waitUntil` has a hard 30s cap. Emails with 6+ attachments may still truncate — these will log via `logError(...)` to `security_logs`. If truncation becomes frequent, migrate to Cloudflare Queues (tracked as a follow-up DL).

**Files touched (code):**
- `api/src/routes/inbound-email.ts` (lines 59–80): `ctx.waitUntil` + 202 response.

**Files touched (.agent/docs):**
- `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/283-n8n-workflow-errors-investigation.md` (new)
- `.agent/design-logs/INDEX.md` (new row)
- `.agent/runbooks/pat-rotation.md` (new)

## Test DL-283: n8n Workflow Errors Fix — NEED TESTING

Verify each item once deploy & credential change have settled. Design log: `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/283-n8n-workflow-errors-investigation.md`

- [ ] **V1 — WF02 credential.** After any fresh Tally questionnaire submission, n8n execution `Fetch Record` node shows `executionStatus: "success"` (not 401).
- [ ] **V2 — WF06 credential + catch-up reminders.** Manually trigger WF06 in n8n UI (`[06] Reminder Scheduler` → "Execute Workflow"). First Airtable node succeeds. Reminders that should have gone today actually send (Type A + Type B emails arrive at test addresses).
- [ ] **V3 — WF06 tomorrow cron.** 2026-04-17 at 08:00 Israel (05:00 UTC), the scheduled cron run completes with `status: success`.
- [ ] **V4 — WF05 async path.** Forward a test email with 1 PDF to `reports@moshe-atsits.co.il`. n8n `Forward to Worker` node completes in <1s with HTTP 202. Airtable classifications record appears within ~15s. OneDrive file uploaded.
- [ ] **V5 — WF05 large batch.** Forward an email with 6+ attachments. Observe whether waitUntil 30s cap truncates. If truncated, check Airtable `security_logs` table for the `logError` entry (endpoint `/process-inbound-email`, `category: INTERNAL`).
- [ ] **V6 — WF02 end-to-end (happy path).** Fresh Tally submission flows through Fetch Record → Get Mappings → Extract & Map → Call Document Service → Upsert Documents + Update Report Stage + Mark Processed. Office email arrives at `reports@moshe-atsits.co.il`.
- [ ] **V7 — MONITOR Security Alerts unchanged.** Next hourly cron run shows `success`.
- [ ] **V8 — Runbook usable.** On the next rotation, the runbook lists every surface that needs updating (add surfaces if you find new ones).

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — Part 14)

### .agent/ Tracking Reorg [COMPLETED]
- **Problem:** `.gitignore` line 26 had broad `.agent/` ignore (commit `f3e43e9`). Worktrees couldn't see 247 design logs — only the 4 tracked before the ignore landed. Agents in worktree sessions started cold, missing cross-session context.
- **Fix:** Removed broad ignore. Tracked 247 new design logs across 10 domain folders + `current-status.md`. Added `.gitattributes` with `merge=union` driver on `current-status.md` so parallel Claude sessions' appends auto-merge without conflicts.
- **Files:** `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (new), `.agent/design-logs/**` (247 new), `.agent/current-status.md`
- **Commit:** `2a9ff3f` (253 files, +35,838 lines)

### P1: Airtable PAT Rotation [COMPLETED — see Priority Queue]
- Leaked token `patvXzYxSlSUEKx9i.25f38a9e...` found hardcoded in DL-112 design log line 94 during `.agent/` staging scan.
- **Rotated:** User regenerated in Airtable Developer Hub. New token verified — HTTP 200 on base `appqBL5RWQN9cPOyh`.
- **n8n updated:** Only `QqEIWQlRs1oZzEtNxFUcQ` WF02 `code-clear-reminder` was active + contained the old token. Updated via MCP `n8n_update_partial_workflow` / `updateNode`. Confirmed new token (`917c1a24...`) is live in workflow, old removed.
- **Skipped:** `QREwCScDZvhF9njF` Send Batch Status (disabled/superseded by Workers). 3 archived workflows (dormant).
- **Redacted:** DL-112:94 → `'<redacted — see .env AIRTABLE_API_KEY / n8n credential>'`.
- **`.env` unaffected:** uses separate token `pat2XQGRyzPdycQWr` — untouched.

### Stale Worktree Cleanup [PARTIAL — FS CLEANUP PENDING]
- Audited 35 worktrees: 34 with ahead=0 (merged or empty), 1 (`claude-session-20260415-215959`) with a superseded partial attempt at the same `.agent/` reorg we completed today.
- **Git-side clean:** All 35 branches deleted (local + remote where applicable). `git worktree list` now shows only main.
- **Filesystem directories still present** at `C:/Users/liozm/Desktop/moshe/worktrees/**` — Windows refused deletion with "Permission denied" (other Claude Code sessions hold open file handles on those directories).
- **To finish:** close all other Claude Code sessions (or reboot), then run `rm -rf C:/Users/liozm/Desktop/moshe/worktrees/` from a shell. Also `.git/worktrees/**` admin dirs got the same permission errors — the same reboot/session-close will let those clear.
- **Skill sharpened:** `~/.claude/skills/design-log/SKILL.md` Phase A step 0 — stale worktree cleanup is now auto-remove for merged/empty branches, ask-first only when a branch has unmerged work.

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-16 (Session — DL-280 fix mobile bottom nav hidden)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — DL-280)

### DL-280: Fix Mobile Bottom Nav Hidden After Login [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Mobile bottom nav (≤768px) never appeared after login. DL-257 added an inline `style="display:none"` FOUC defense on `<nav class="bottom-nav">`; the CSS `.bottom-nav.visible { display: flex }` had no `!important`, so the inline style won on specificity and the `.visible` class toggle was a no-op. Bug surfaced clearly after DL-276 consolidated all auth-success paths through `_showAppUI()`.
- **Fix:** In `_showAppUI()` clear `bottomNav.style.display` before adding `.visible`; in the `pageshow` bfcache handler, set it back to `'none'` when hiding. Symmetric state reset, no CSS or HTML change.
- File touched: `frontend/admin/js/script.js` (lines 155-164, 266-274).
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/280-fix-mobile-bottom-nav-hidden.md`

**Test checklist (DL-280):**
- [ ] Fresh load on mobile viewport (DevTools 375px) with valid session — bottom nav visible immediately after splash fades
- [ ] Login from login screen on mobile viewport — bottom nav appears after auth completes
- [ ] Tab through dashboard → import → AI review on mobile — nav stays visible across all tabs
- [ ] Reload page on mobile with valid session (same-tab path in `checkAuth`) — nav appears
- [ ] Open /admin in a new tab with valid localStorage token (verify+prefetch path) — nav appears
- [ ] Desktop (>768px) — nav remains hidden (CSS `.bottom-nav { display: none }` still wins)
- [ ] bfcache: navigate away + back with valid token — nav still visible
- [ ] bfcache: navigate away + back after token expiry — nav hides, login screen shown, no FOUC flash on next forward nav
- [ ] Real mobile device (Safari iOS / Chrome Android) — verify no FOUC flicker of nav during login screen render

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13f)

### DL-279: Fix Forwarded Note Sender Email [COMPLETED]
- **Problem:** When office member (Natan) forwards a client email to the inbox, the client note showed Natan's email instead of the client's email. Also, spouse (Tal/bigeltal@gmail.com) sent the email but note should show primary client email (Shlomit/bigelmanit@gmail.com).
- **Fix 1 — processor.ts:** `summarizeAndSaveNote()` now receives `reportClientEmail` (from report's `client_email` lookup field) instead of `metadata.senderEmail`. Falls back to `clientMatch.email` if lookup is empty.
- **Fix 2 — frontend:** Added `replace(/[\n\r\t]/g, ...)` pre-sanitization before `JSON.parse(client_notes)` in both `document-manager.js` and `admin/js/script.js`. Airtable long text fields can convert `\n` escapes into literal newlines, breaking JSON parse.
- **Backfill:** Fixed CPA-XXX's note data in Airtable (re-serialized with proper JSON escaping + corrected sender_email). Added `/webhook/backfill-note-sender` temp endpoint.
- All changes merged to main.

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13e)

### DL-278: AI Review Client List — Viewport-Locked Layout [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** AI review master panel (client accordion list) grew unbounded, extending far below the sticky preview panel.
- **Fix:** Viewport-locked grid (`height: calc(100vh - 200px)`) with independent scrolling on master panel. Removed `position: sticky` from detail panel (now fills grid height). Accordion content `max-height` changed from `60vh` to `calc(100vh - 350px)` to auto-fit preview height. Mobile breakpoint unsets height lock.
- CSS-only change in `frontend/admin/css/style.css`.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/278-ai-review-client-list-layout.md`

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Both panels visible side-by-side without page scroll
- [ ] Master panel scrolls internally through all client accordions
- [ ] Opening an accordion shows cards within the panel
- [ ] Preview panel displays document when clicking preview button
- [ ] Pagination controls visible at bottom of master scroll
- [ ] Mobile layout (<768px) still works — single column, no height lock
- [ ] No regression on other tabs

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13d)

### DL-277: Fix Reminder Progress Bar Math & Classification 429 Retry [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Bug A — Progress bar:** Type B reminder email showed "חסרים: 10" when total=11, received=0. Root cause: `_docs_missing` counted only `Required_Missing` docs, but `_docs_total` (Airtable COUNT) included Waived. Fix: `displayTotal = received + missing` — waived excluded from both.
- **Bug B — Classification 429:** 19 PDFs from CPA-XXX email, 14 failed with Anthropic 429 rate limit. No retry logic existed. Fix: Added `fetchWithRetry()` with 3 retries + exponential backoff in `document-classifier.ts`, plus 1s inter-batch delay in `processor.ts`.
- **New endpoint:** `re-classify` action on `/webhook/review-classification` — re-downloads PDF from OneDrive, re-runs AI classification, updates Airtable.
- **CPA-XXX records:** All 15 rate-limited records re-classified successfully. 14 matched templates, 1 unmatched.
- Workers deployed: version 02329de2
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/email/277-fix-reminder-progress-bar-and-429-retry.md`

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Trigger Type B reminder for a report with waived docs — verify progress bar excludes waived from both total and missing
- [ ] Send email with 10+ attachments — verify no 429 errors (retry logic works)
- [ ] Admin AI review: CPA-XXX's 15 records show proper classifications

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13c)

### DL-276: Smooth Admin Auth Flow [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Navigating to `/admin` showed "tack tack tack" — login screen flash → app appears → dashboard populates.
- **Fix:** Auth splash screen (logo + bouncing dots) visible by default. Both login and app hidden until JS decides. Splash fades out (200ms). Parallel dashboard prefetch on token verify. Login button uses inline bouncing dots instead of full-screen overlay.
- **Also fixed:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` was accidentally gitignored (commit `ae5f66f`), breaking all deploys after that point. Restored workflow + fixed `.gitignore` to exclude `.github/*` but include `.github/workflows/`.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/276-smooth-admin-auth-flow.md`

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin` with valid session (same tab) — splash → app, no login flash
- [ ] Open `/admin` in new tab with valid localStorage token — splash → app
- [ ] Open `/admin` with no token — splash → login screen
- [ ] Open `/admin` with expired/invalid token — splash → login screen
- [ ] Login from login screen — inline dots on button, no full-screen overlay
- [ ] Logout → login screen appears correctly
- [ ] Dashboard data populated when app appears (parallel prefetch)
- [ ] Mobile: same behavior on small screens

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13b)

### DL-275: Fix Zero-Document Questionnaires Stuck at Waiting_For_Answers [COMPLETED]
- **Root cause:** WF02 Merge node (`Wait for Both`) blocked when Document Service returned 0 documents — `Prepare for Airtable` returned 0 items, so `Upsert Documents` never fired, merge never completed, `Update Report Stage` and `Mark Processed` never executed.
- **Fix:** Removed `Wait for Both` merge node. Connected `Update Report Stage` and `Mark Processed` directly from `Success?` TRUE branch. All 4 downstream operations now fire independently.
- **Backfill:** Updated 6 reports to stage=Review (CPA-XXX, CPA-XXX, CPA-XXX, CPA-XXX, CPA-XXX, CPA-XXX). Cleared reminder_next_date to prevent Type A reminders. Marked 8 Tally submissions as התקבל.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/275-fix-zero-docs-stage-stuck.md`

**All tests passed:**
- [x] Submit test questionnaire with all "no" answers → stage advances to Review (CPA-XXX, execution 11848)
- [x] Verify 6 backfilled reports show stage=Review in admin panel
- [x] Verify reminder_next_date is null on all 7 reports (6 backfilled + 1 new)
- [x] Verify 8 backfilled Tally submissions show סטטוס=התקבל
- [x] Verify Update Report Stage node fires directly from Success? branch

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 13)

### DL-272: Dashboard Messages — Load More + Same-Day Sort Fix [COMPLETED]
- Client-side pagination: API returns all messages (no slice cap), frontend shows 10 at a time with "הצג עוד..." link
- Sort fix: inbound processor now stores full ISO timestamps; tiebreaker sort using note ID for existing date-only notes
- Delete/hide synced with in-memory `_allMessages` array

### DL-274: Dashboard Messages — Search Bar [COMPLETED]
- Search input in panel header with X clear button, debounced 300ms
- Fetch-once pattern: first search loads ALL messages across all years (cached 30 min in KV), subsequent keystrokes filter instantly client-side
- Spinner + "מחפש..." shown during initial fetch
- Variable name bug fix: `filterFormula` → `filterByFormula` (caused 500 on first deploy)
- Badge count removed from panel header per user feedback
- Workers deployed 3x this session

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 12)

### DL-273: Replace KV+Cron Queue with MS Graph Deferred Send [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Off-hours email queue used KV + daily cron (05:00 UTC). Cron fired at 07:00 Israel in winter (DST). Extra infrastructure for simple "send later".
- **Solution:** MS Graph `PidTagDeferredSendTime` — Exchange holds email in Outbox until 08:00 Israel. Eliminates cron entirely.
- **New methods:** `sendMailDeferred()` and `replyToMessageDeferred()` on MSGraphClient (draft→send with extended property)
- **Key change:** Airtable stage transitions happen immediately on off-hours approval (no longer delayed until cron)
- **Removed:** `email-queue.ts` (121 lines), `scheduled` handler, cron trigger from wrangler.toml
- **Files changed:** `ms-graph.ts`, `israel-time.ts`, `approve-and-send.ts`, `dashboard.ts`, `index.ts`, `wrangler.toml`
- Worker deployed: `a00a4e21-3db8-4ba2-9a09-df00bbef5b53`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/email/273-outlook-deferred-send.md`

### Cleanup: Remove Debug console.log [COMPLETED]
- Removed 3 debug `console.log` lines from `approve-and-send.ts` (added during DL-272)

**Test DL-273** — test plan in design log Section 7:
- [ ] Off-hours approve-and-send: email arrives at ~08:00 Israel
- [ ] Off-hours comment reply (threaded): arrives at ~08:00 in correct thread
- [ ] Off-hours comment reply (non-threaded): arrives at ~08:00
- [ ] Business-hours flows: unchanged (immediate send)
- [ ] UI toast + button show queued state on off-hours approval
- [ ] Airtable stage advances immediately on off-hours approval
- [ ] No cron errors in Worker logs

**Follow-up items:**
1. Consider clearing `queued_send_at` on next dashboard load after 08:00 passes (low priority — cosmetic)
2. Dashboard queued count on stage 3 card still works but shows count even after client moves to Collecting_Docs

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 11)

### DL-272: Dashboard Messages — Load More + Same-Day Sort Fix [IMPLEMENTED — NEED DEPLOY]
- **Load more:** Client-side pagination — API now returns all messages (no `slice(0, 10)` cap), frontend shows 10 at a time with "הצג עוד..." link
- **Sort fix:** Inbound processor (`processor.ts:349`) was stripping time from dates (`.split('T')[0]`), causing same-day messages to appear in random order. Now stores full ISO timestamp. Added tiebreaker sort using note ID timestamp for existing date-only notes.
- **State sync:** Delete/hide now removes from in-memory `_allMessages` array and re-renders (not just DOM manipulation)
- **Files changed:** `api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `frontend/admin/js/script.js`, `frontend/admin/css/style.css`
- **Blocked:** Workers deploy failed due to network issue — need to run `npx wrangler deploy` from `api/` directory
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/272-dashboard-messages-load-more.md`

**Test TODO (DL-272):**
- [ ] Deploy Workers: `cd api && npx wrangler deploy`
- [ ] Dashboard shows first 10 messages, "הצג עוד..." link visible
- [ ] Click load more → 10 more messages appear, link updates count
- [ ] Link disappears when all messages shown
- [ ] Badge shows total count
- [ ] Same-day messages sorted newest-first
- [ ] Delete/hide still works after load more
- [ ] Reply still works after load more
- [ ] Mobile layout not broken

## Session Summary (2026-04-15 — Part 11b)

### Fix Negative/Wrong Days in מוכנים להכנה Tab [COMPLETED]
- **Bug 1:** `(-1) ימים` showed when `docs_completed_at` was slightly ahead of browser time (timezone offset)
- **Fix 1:** `Math.max(0, ...)` clamp on `diffDays`
- **Bug 2:** Yesterday's date showed "היום" instead of "יום אחד" — timestamp diff < 24h but different calendar day
- **Fix 2:** Compare midnight-to-midnight dates instead of raw timestamps (both desktop table + mobile cards)
- File changed: `frontend/admin/js/script.js` (lines 2587-2589, 2634-2636)

### Skill & Memory Updates
- `/design-log` Phase 0: added stale worktree cleanup step (`git worktree list`)
- Memory: `feedback_worktree_cleanup.md` — ExitWorktree won't work for CLI `--worktree`

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 10)

### WF07 Daily Digest — IF Node Type Validation Fix [COMPLETED]
- **Bug:** "IF Has Client Emails" node in WF07 (`0o6pXPeewCRxEEhd`) failed with "Wrong type: '' is a string but was expecting a boolean" at 20:00 cron run
- **Root cause:** `typeValidation: "strict"` on the IF node rejected empty string when `$json._hasClients` was undefined/falsy
- **Fix:** Changed `typeValidation` from `"strict"` to `"loose"` via n8n REST API — matches the "Skip Weekend" IF node pattern in the same workflow
- No local file changes — fix applied directly to n8n

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 9)

### DL-272: Port DL-266 Send-Comment Endpoint + Fix Approve-and-Send [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- Ported full DL-266 API implementation from old repo (`annual-reports-old` branch `DL-266-reply-to-client-messages`)
- **New endpoint:** `POST /webhook/admin-send-comment` in `dashboard.ts` — reply to client messages with branded email, off-hours queue, Outlook threading
- **New email builder:** `buildCommentEmailHtml()` + `buildCommentEmailSubject()` in `email-html.ts`
- **New MS Graph method:** `replyToMessage()` — two-step createReply+send for Outlook thread continuity
- **New cron handler:** `processQueuedComments()` in `email-queue.ts` — processes `queued_comment:*` KV keys
- **Reply map:** GET `/admin-recent-messages` now returns `reply` field per message for threaded display
- **Bug fix:** `showAIToast` → `showToast` in doc-manager queued handler — this was the actual cause of the off-hours approve-and-send error since DL-264
- **Bug fix:** `queued_send_at` Airtable update wrapped in try/catch (non-critical)
- **Persistent button lock:** Doc-manager shows "⏰ ישלח ב-08:00" (disabled) on page load when `queued_send_at` is set
- **Hook removed:** `banned-frontend-patterns.js` — was blocking debug and not useful enough to keep
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/266-reply-to-client-messages.md` (ported from old repo)
- Worker deployed 4x, all changes merged to main

~~**Test DL-272**~~ — NOT TESTED (test plan: `.agent/test-plan-2026-04-15.md` Suite 1)

**Follow-up items (next session):**
1. **Dashboard queued-client visibility** — queued clients in Pending_Approval should show ⏰ badge + grayed row in dashboard table so other users don't double-approve. Remove ugly "(X בתור לשליחה)" from stat card.
2. **Queued reply timestamp** — dashboard messages panel shows the note's save time (e.g. "20:34") for queued replies, but the email won't send until 08:00. Should show "יישלח ב-08:00 ⏰" instead of the save timestamp. Also fix all "ישלח" → "יישלח" and move ⏰ emoji to left side (RTL) across doc-manager button text.
3. **Verify morning cron** — check at 08:00 Israel time (05:00 UTC) that both queued approve-and-send emails AND queued comment replies actually fire.
4. **Outlook deferred send** — replace KV+cron queue with MS Graph `PidTagDeferredSendTime` (scheduled send). Simpler architecture, Outlook handles delivery timing. Eliminates `processQueuedEmails`/`processQueuedComments` cron entirely.
5. **Remove debug console.log** — 3 temporary `console.log` lines in doc-manager approve-and-send handler.

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 8)

### DL-268: AI Review Pagination by Client + FIFO Sort [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- Pagination now counts **client groups** (25/page) instead of documents (was 50 docs/page)
- FIFO sort: oldest-waiting client appears first (by earliest `received_at` ascending)
- Summary bar shows total doc/client counts across ALL pages, not just current page
- File changed: `frontend/admin/js/script.js`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/268-ai-review-pagination.md`
- Commits: `4f08176`, `90c0c6e` (sync to frontend/ path)

### Root-Level Frontend Duplicates Removed [COMPLETED]
- Deleted 40 root-level files (admin/, assets/, shared/, n8n/, *.html) — 29,725 lines
- `frontend/` is now the sole canonical location for all frontend files
- GitHub Pages deploys from `frontend/**` only (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
- Commit: `63d283e`

### Design-Log Skill Updated
- Phase D Step 7: auto-merge to main after push (no "merge to main?" question)
- Merge IS the deploy for testing on GitHub Pages

~~**Test DL-268**~~ — NOT TESTED (test plan: `.agent/test-plan-2026-04-15.md` Suite 2)

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 7)

### n8n Workflow URL Migration [COMPLETED]
- Migrated all 6 active n8n workflows from `liozshor.github.io/annual-reports-client-portal` to `docs.moshe-atsits.com`
- 19 total occurrences replaced (URLs in Code nodes + CORS headers)
- Workflows updated: [SUB] Document Service (4), [06] Reminder Scheduler (4), [API] Send Batch Status (6), [04] Document Edit Handler (2), [MONITOR] Security Alerts (1), [07] Daily Natan Digest (2)
- CORS: Edit Handler webhook keeps both origins for backward compat; Batch Status respond nodes switched to new domain
- Also committed `.dev.vars*` gitignore entries
- Commit: `78a2b59` on main

**TODO (carried forward):**
- [x] ~~Update n8n workflow URLs to use custom domain~~ (done this session)
- [ ] Verify `docs.moshe-atsits.com` admin login works (CORS resolved)
- [ ] Delete root-level duplicate frontend files (separate PR after stability confirmed)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 6)

### Session Start Enforcement Hooks [IMPLEMENTED]
- **`session-start-check.sh`** (SessionStart hook) — warns on main/master branch + uncommitted changes + worktree detection
- **`branch-guard.sh`** (PreToolUse hook) — blocks Edit/Write on main/master (exit 2), runs before all other Edit|Write hooks
- Both wired in `.claude/settings.json`, tested live (branch-guard blocked a write mid-session)
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/DL-SESSION-START-ENFORCEMENT.md`
- Branch: `feat/session-start-enforcement` (pushed, not yet merged to main)

### Design-Log Skill Updated (Global)
- Phase A step 0: worktree-aware branch setup — detects parallel sessions, offers `git worktree add`
- Phase D step 7: worktree cleanup after merge — `git worktree remove` prompt
- File: `~/.claude/skills/design-log/SKILL.md` (global, not git-tracked)

### Custom Domain CNAME + CORS Fix [DEPLOYED]
- Created `frontend/CNAME` → `docs.moshe-atsits.com` (committed to main, `88cfeda`)
- CORS middleware updated to accept comma-separated origins (Hono `string[]`)
- `wrangler.toml` `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` now includes: `liozshor.github.io`, `docs.moshe-atsits.com` (https + http)
- Worker deployed (`f24e08a1`)

**TODO:**
- [ ] Merge `feat/session-start-enforcement` to main (2 commits: hooks + CORS fix)
- [ ] Verify `docs.moshe-atsits.com` admin login works (CORS resolved)
- [ ] Set up HTTPS for custom domain (currently included http:// as fallback)
- [ ] Update `FRONTEND_BASE` constants in Workers code to use custom domain (email links still point to github.io)

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 5)

### DL-MONOREPO: Git Monorepo Migration [IMPLEMENTED — MONITORING]
- **What:** Merged outer local-only repo into GitHub repo (`LiozShor/annual-reports-client-portal`). Single repo, single remote, worktrees work natively.
- **Structure:** `frontend/` = GitHub Pages (deployed via GitHub Actions), `api/` = Cloudflare Workers, `docs/`, `.claude/`, `.agent/` = project tooling
- **Root frontend files kept** for backward compat — delete in separate PR after 1-2 days stability
- **Secrets protected:** `.env`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `archive/keys.txt`, `docs/wf05-backup-*.json` all gitignored. Airtable PAT in design log 112 redacted.
- **Hooks updated:** 3 hooks had hardcoded `github/annual-reports-client-portal/` → changed to `frontend/`
- **Path refs updated:** CLAUDE.md, airtable-safety.md, SSOT docs, architecture.md, project-overview.md, cs-hardcoded-audit.md, ssot-verify skill, n8n comment URLs

**TODO:**
- [ ] Rename local directories after closing this Claude Code session: `mv annual-reports annual-reports-OLD && mv annual-reports-monorepo annual-reports`
- [ ] Delete root-level duplicate frontend files (separate PR after 1-2 days of stability)
- [ ] Delete `annual-reports-OLD` after confirming everything works for a week
- [ ] Test full worktree workflow with a real ticket
- [ ] Update memory files that reference `github/annual-reports-client-portal/`

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 4)

### DL-267: Auto-Advance to Review When Zero Docs Remaining [VERIFIED ✓]
- **Feature:** Reports with `docs_missing_count === 0` in `Pending_Approval` or `Collecting_Docs` auto-advance to `Review`. No manual office action needed.
- **Manually tested 2026-04-14:** CPA-XXX reduced to 2 docs, both waived → auto-advanced to Review. All validation items passed.

**TODO:** Remove backfill endpoint after confirming no more stuck reports.

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 3)

### DL-265: Entity Tab Switch Loading Indicator + UX Polish [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Loading indicator:** Bouncing dots loader with Hebrew text ("טוען לוח בקרה…", etc.) on entity tab switch (AR↔CS). White frosted overlay + backdrop-blur, fade-in animation.
- **Mobile auto-scroll:** Tapping a stat card filter on mobile now smooth-scrolls to the client table.
- **New tab navigation:** Clicking client name in dashboard table opens doc-manager in a new tab (desktop only; mobile stays same-tab).
- **Multi-tab safety rules:** Added global + project rules to prevent parallel Claude Code sessions from clobbering each other's uncommitted changes. Updated skills: git-ship (pre-ship validation), debug, qa-test, silent-failure-hunt, ssot-verify.
- **Files changed:** `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/index.html`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, 5 skill files

**Test DL-265:**
- [ ] Switch AR→CS on dashboard → bouncing dots + "טוען לוח בקרה…" overlay appears, disappears on load
- [ ] Same on Send/Questionnaires/Reminders tabs → correct Hebrew label per tab
- [ ] Mobile: stat card tap → page scrolls to table
- [ ] Mobile: bouncing dots appear with padding-top:80px (smaller gap)
- [ ] Desktop: click client name → doc-manager opens in new tab
- [ ] Mobile: tap client name → doc-manager opens in same tab

## Session Summary (2026-04-14 — Part 2)

### DL-264: Off-Hours Email Queue [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Feature:** Approve-and-send during 8PM-8AM (Israel time) queues emails in KV, delivered at ~8AM by Worker cron trigger. Sub-status on Pending_Approval stage (not a new pipeline stage).
- **Backend:** New `israel-time.ts` (DST-safe via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`), `email-queue.ts` (morning batch processor). Modified `approve-and-send.ts` to fork on `isOffHours()`. Added `scheduled` handler to `index.ts`. Cron `0 5 * * *` in `wrangler.toml`.
- **Frontend:** `document-manager.js` shows "⏰ ישלח ב-08:00" + toast on queued approval. `approve-confirm.html` has queued success state. Dashboard stage 3 card shows "(N בתור לשליחה)" subtitle.
- **Airtable:** New `queued_send_at` field (dateTime, `fld18iNopKSFdbXxX`).
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/israel-time.ts`, `api/src/lib/email-queue.ts`, `api/src/routes/approve-and-send.ts`, `api/src/index.ts`, `api/wrangler.toml`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `document-manager.js`, `approve-confirm.html`, `admin/js/script.js`

**Test DL-264:**
- [ ] Approve client after 20:00 Israel → response says queued, KV key created, Airtable has queued_send_at
- [ ] Approve client 08:00-20:00 Israel → sends immediately (unchanged behavior)
- [ ] Dashboard shows queued count on stage 3 card
- [ ] Document manager shows "⏰ ישלח ב-08:00" badge after off-hours approval
- [ ] approve-confirm.html shows queued success page with clock icon
- [ ] Trigger cron manually → queued emails send, stage → Collecting_Docs, KV keys deleted
- [ ] Duplicate off-hours approval → KV key overwrites (idempotent)
- [ ] No regression: daytime approve-and-send works identically

## Session Summary (2026-04-14)

### DL-263: Dashboard Messages — Delete/Hide + Raw Text Only [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Feature:** Replaced AI summaries with raw email text in dashboard messages panel. Added delete/hide option with inline action buttons.
- **API:** New `delete-client-note` action in `client.ts` (permanent delete or hide-from-dashboard with `hidden_from_dashboard` flag). Added `note.id` to recent-messages response. Filters hidden notes server-side. KV cache invalidation on mutation.
- **Frontend:** Raw snippet shown inline (2-line clamp), hover expands full text on desktop, tap-to-expand on mobile. Two always-visible action buttons per row: folder-open (opens doc-manager in new tab) + trash (inline delete/hide actions). Inline action panel replaces row content (no modal).
- **Files:** `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `api/src/routes/client.ts`, `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/index.html` (cache bust v=263b)

**Test DL-263:**
- [ ] Messages show raw email text in quotes (not AI summary)
- [ ] Hover on desktop expands full text (removes 2-line clamp)
- [ ] Tap on mobile toggles expanded/collapsed
- [ ] Folder-open icon opens doc-manager in new tab
- [ ] Trash icon shows inline actions: "מחק לצמיתות" / "הסתר מהדשבורד" / "ביטול"
- [ ] "מחק לצמיתות" permanently removes note from Airtable + dashboard
- [ ] "הסתר מהדשבורד" hides from dashboard but note remains in doc-manager
- [ ] "ביטול" restores original row content
- [ ] After delete/hide, row fades out, badge count updates
- [ ] Refresh page: deleted/hidden messages stay gone
- [ ] No regression: clients table still works

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 4)

### DL-261: Dashboard Recent Client Messages Panel [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Feature:** Sticky side panel on dashboard showing 10 most recent client emails
- **API:** New `GET /admin-recent-messages` endpoint with 5-min KV cache
- **Frontend:** 2-column grid layout, hover shows raw snippet as blockquote, click navigates to doc-manager
- **Files:** `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `admin/index.html`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/js/script.js`, `shared/endpoints.js`

### DL-262: WF05 Email Note Quality [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Raw snippets had quoted replies, signatures, `&quot;` entities; summaries described our own outbound template
- **Fix:** Added `stripQuotedContent()` pre-strip, switched Haiku to `tool_use` structured extraction, fixed entity decoding
- **Backfill:** 10 records re-processed with clean summaries and snippets
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`

**Test DL-261:**
- [ ] Panel loads with messages next to clients table
- [x] Click navigates to correct client doc-manager (now opens in new tab via DL-263)
- [x] Hover shows raw snippet inline (DL-263: raw text is now primary, hover expands)
- [ ] Mobile (<900px): panel stacks above table
- [ ] Clients table still works (filters, pagination)

**Test DL-262:**
- [ ] New inbound email → summary describes only client's new content
- [ ] Raw snippet has no signatures or quoted chains
- [ ] No `&quot;` entities in stored data
- [ ] Backfilled records show clean data in dashboard

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 3)

### DL-259: Capture Client Notes & Attachments at All Stages [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Inbound email processor only looked for reports at Collecting_Docs/Review. Emails from earlier/later stages silently dropped (NeedsHuman).
- **Fix:** Added `getAllReports` (no stage filter). Two-tier flow: always save note + raw upload, only classify at Collecting_Docs/Review.
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/inbound/processor.ts`
- **Worker version:** `aa1964f1`

**Test DL-259:**
- [ ] Trigger inbound email for CPA-XXX (Waiting_For_Answers) → client_notes populated
- [ ] Email event marked Completed
- [ ] Collecting_Docs client: full classification still works
- [ ] Truly unknown client: still NeedsHuman
- [ ] Doc-manager shows note via DL-258 secondary zone

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 2)

### DL-258: Client Messages on Low-Stage Doc Manager [DONE]
- **Problem:** Stage 1 doc manager early-returns before showing secondary zone (notes, client messages, rejected uploads). Clients may email before filling questionnaire — office can't see those messages.
- **Fix:** Extracted `.secondary-zone` HTML from `#content` into standalone `#secondaryZone` sibling. JS shows it at all stages independently.
- **Files:** `document-manager.html`, `assets/js/document-manager.js`
- **Commit:** `798e06e` (submodule)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-13 — Part 1)

### DL-257: Mobile Bottom Nav Auth Gate [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Bottom nav visible on login screen before auth (bfcache + FOUC)
- **Fix:** `style="display:none"` on `#bottomNav`, replace CSS sibling selector with `.bottom-nav.visible`, add JS `.visible` at 3 auth points, add `pageshow` bfcache guard
- **Files:** `admin/index.html`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/js/script.js`
- **Commit:** `0ab131d`

**Test DL-257 nav gate:**
- [ ] Fresh load on mobile (no session) — login screen shows, bottom nav hidden
- [ ] Login on mobile — bottom nav appears after auth
- [ ] Refresh page (with session) — bottom nav reappears
- [ ] Slow 3G DevTools — no FOUC flash
- [ ] Desktop — bottom nav stays hidden (no regression)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 7)

### DL-257: Reminder Select-All Bug Fix & Bulk Cap [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** "Select all" in reminders tab shows 100 selected (not 50). Root cause: each item renders 2 `.reminder-checkbox` elements (desktop table + mobile card) sharing same value. Also no bulk cap like questionnaires tab.
- **Fix:** Dedup all checkbox queries via `Set`, added `MAX_BULK_SEND=50` cap to `toggleSectionSelectAll` and `toggleReminderSelectAll`, disable unchecked boxes at limit
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`

**Test DL-257:**
- [ ] Click section "select all" → count shows 50 (not 100)
- [ ] Unchecked checkboxes disabled at limit
- [ ] Uncheck one → re-enables unchecked boxes
- [ ] Bulk send → 50 unique report IDs sent
- [ ] Mobile view: same behavior
- [ ] Navigate to page 2 → can select another batch
- [ ] Muted client warning still works
- [ ] Cancel selection → all checkboxes cleared and re-enabled

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 6)

### DL-256: Table Pagination — 50 Rows Per Page [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** 579 clients → 1.5-2.5s icon creation, 852-2484ms click handler violations
- **Fix:** Shared `renderPagination()` utility with Hebrew RTL pagination bar (« הקודם | 1 2 3 ... | הבא »)
- **All 4 tables paginated:** Dashboard clients, questionnaires, reminders, AI review cards
- **Reminders fix:** Per-section pagination (Type A / Type B each get independent pagination inside accordion)
- **DL-255 hide/show logic replaced** — pagination renders only 50 rows, eliminating DOM bottleneck
- **Scoped `safeCreateIcons(root)`** — icon creation scoped to container element (no full-document scan)
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/css/style.css`, `admin/index.html`

**Test DL-256:**
- [ ] Login → dashboard shows 50 rows, pagination bar at bottom
- [ ] Click page 2 → next 50 rows shown
- [ ] Stage filter → resets to page 1, correct total
- [ ] Search → resets to page 1
- [ ] "מציג 1-50 מתוך N" label correct
- [ ] Stat cards still show full totals
- [ ] Questionnaires, reminders, AI review paginated
- [ ] No timeout errors on dashboard load

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 5)

### Bug Fix: Infinite Reload Loop [PUSHED]
- **Problem:** Fresh visit (no token) → `DOMContentLoaded→switchEntityTab→loadDashboard` with empty auth → API returns unauthorized → `logout()→location.reload()` → infinite loop
- **Fix:** Added `if (!authToken) return;` guard to all 5 data-loading functions
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`

### DL-254: Dashboard Load Performance [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** 10 API calls on returning user (dashboard x2, classifications x3, pending x2, reminders x2). 579 clients.
- **Fixes:**
  - Fix double-load: `loadedAt > 0` guards in `switchEntityTab` prevent duplicate loads on init
  - Dedup `loadAIReviewCount` via `deduplicatedFetch` (was `fetchWithTimeout`)
  - Fix timeout mismatch: `loadAIReviewCount` uses `FETCH_TIMEOUTS.slow` to match shared dedup request
  - Stagger prefetches in `requestIdleCallback` — dashboard renders first
  - Bump AI review + reminders timeout 10s → 20s
  - **API:** KV-cache `available_years` (1hr TTL), invalidate on rollover
  - **API:** KV-cache `documents_non_waived` (5min TTL), invalidate on approve/review
  - **API:** Parallelize sequential batch report fetches in classifications endpoint
- **Results:** Returning user: 10 → 5 API calls (50% reduction). Worker deployed.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/254-dashboard-load-performance.md`

**Test DL-254:**
- [ ] Returning user reload → exactly 1 `admin-dashboard`, 1 `get-pending-classifications` in Network tab
- [ ] Fresh login → dashboard renders, prefetches fire after
- [ ] AI Review tab loads without error
- [ ] Reminders tab loads without error

### DL-255: Table Rendering Performance [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Every filter keystroke triggers full innerHTML rebuild of 578 rows + 2300 Lucide icon re-creations
- **Fixes:**
  - Hide/show pattern for dashboard clients table: render ALL entity-filtered rows once, toggle `display:none` for search/stage/year
  - 150ms debounce on all 4 search inputs
  - CSS `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen table rows
- **Results:** Stage filter: 21ms, search: 13ms, back-to-all: 20ms (all <25ms, was 6700ms+)
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/255-table-rendering-performance.md`

**Test DL-255:**
- [ ] Type in search — no jank, results filter smoothly
- [ ] Click stage stat card — rows hide/show instantly
- [ ] Sort by column — full rebuild, correct order
- [ ] Entity tab switch (AR→CS) — data reloads correctly
- [ ] Mobile cards also filter correctly
- [ ] Bulk selection works on visible rows

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 4)

### DL-251: View Documents — Filing Type Badge [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Dual AR+CS clients couldn't tell which filing type they were viewing on the view-documents page. Tabs existed (DL-218) but were too subtle.
- **Fix:** Added a color-coded pill badge in the header area (blue for AR, purple for CS). Reuses admin panel badge pattern. Only shows for dual-filing clients. Updates on tab switch and language change.
- **Files:** `view-documents.css`, `view-documents.html`, `view-documents.js`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/client-portal/251-view-documents-filing-type-badge.md`

**Test DL-251:**
- [ ] Single-filing AR client: no badge visible
- [ ] Dual AR+CS client: badge visible in header
- [ ] Switch tabs: badge updates (text + color)
- [ ] Switch language: badge text updates (HE/EN)
- [ ] Mobile: badge doesn't break header layout

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 3)

### DL-250: Entity Tab Switch Fix [COMPLETED]
- **Problem:** Switching AR↔CS entity tabs on the dashboard didn't reload data; on the import tab, content stayed faded at 50% opacity.
- **Root causes:** (1) `switchEntityTab()` set `dashboardLoaded=false` then checked `if(dashboardLoaded)` (dead code), and the reload section had no `dashboard` case. (2) `.tab-refreshing` class applied to ALL tabs but only removed for tabs with load functions — import tab stuck at 50% opacity.
- **Fixes:** Added dashboard case to reload section, removed dead code block, restructured `.tab-refreshing` to only apply to tabs that actually fetch data.
- **Bonus:** Added filing type badge to import tab header for visual feedback.
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/index.html`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/250-entity-tab-switch-dashboard-reload.md`

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-12 — Part 2)

### DL-243: CS Help Text Import [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Context:** Natan returned filled Excel with Hebrew help text for CS document templates (view-documents `?` icons).
- **Imported:** 16/22 CS templates with `help_he` (6 intentionally empty — self-explanatory docs).
- **English:** Generated and imported `help_en` translations for all 16 templates.
- **Fixes:** Hardcoded "31.12.2025" → "31.12.{year}" in CS-T010 and CS-T018.
- **Cache:** KV `cache:templates` purged — changes are live.
- **No code changes** — existing pipeline serves CS help text identically to AR.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/capital-statements/243-cs-help-text-content.md`

**Test DL-243:**
- [ ] Open a CS client's view-documents page — `?` icons appear next to documents
- [ ] Click `?` → accordion expands with Hebrew help text
- [ ] Toggle language → English help text shows
- [ ] Documents with `{year}` placeholder show correct year (not "2025")
- [ ] Empty templates (CS-T004, T006, T007, T012, T019, T020) show no `?` icon
- [ ] AR view-documents still works unchanged (regression)

## Session Summary (2026-04-12)

### DL-248: Fix Upload Document Endpoint [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Admin upload in doc-manager.html returned 400: "Report has no OneDrive root folder configured"
- **Root causes:** (1) `upload-document.ts` read `onedrive_root_folder_id` from report record (doesn't exist — field is on clients table). (2) Used `display_name`/`name` fields (don't exist on documents table) — every file saved as "document.pdf".
- **Fix:** Replaced with `resolveOneDriveRoot()` + `uploadToOneDrive()` from attachment-utils. Changed filename source to `issuer_name` field.
- **Also:** Refreshed 31 stale `file_url` values via temp endpoint. Renamed 7 old `דוחות שנתיים` folders to `דוח שנתי`. Cleared 1 broken item (אלביט — deleted from OneDrive).
- **Files:** `api/src/routes/upload-document.ts`

**Test DL-248:**
- [x] Upload file via doc-manager — no 400 error
- [ ] Verify uploaded file appears in OneDrive with correct Hebrew document name
- [ ] Verify Airtable doc record updated: file_url, onedrive_item_id, status=Received

### DL-249: Auto-Create Client OneDrive Folders [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** OneDrive folders only created on-demand during first upload. New clients had no folder structure.
- **Solution:** `createClientFolderStructure()` helper creates full `clientName/year/filingType/` hierarchy. Wired into bulk import + year rollover. Backfill ran: 40/40 existing combos, 0 errors.
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/inbound/attachment-utils.ts`, `api/src/routes/import.ts`, `api/src/routes/rollover.ts`

**Test DL-249:**
- [ ] Bulk import with new test client — verify folder appears in OneDrive
- [ ] Year rollover — verify new year folder created
- [ ] Verify existing upload/inbound flows still work (no regression)

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-09 — Part 2)

### DL-247: Tab Switching Performance & Smart Loading [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Full-screen blocking overlay ("טוען סיווגים...") shown on every tab switch, even when data is cached. AI review never prefetched.
- **Solution:** Stale-while-revalidate pattern — show cached data instantly, refresh silently in background. Full-screen overlay reserved for mutations only.
- **Key changes:**
  - Removed `showLoading`/`hideLoading` from all 5 tab load functions
  - Added `*LoadedAt` timestamps + `STALE_AFTER_MS = 30s` staleness check
  - `switchTab()` always passes `silent=true` (was passing `*Loaded` flag)
  - AI review added to dashboard prefetch list
  - `deduplicatedFetch` (existing but unused) wired into 3 GET-based loaders (pending, AI review, questionnaires)
  - Fixed `deduplicatedFetch` to clone responses (Response body can only be read once)
  - `switchEntityTab()` uses opacity fade instead of full-screen overlay
  - First-ever tab load shows inline CSS spinner (`.tab-loading-inline`)
- **Files:** `admin/js/script.js`, `admin/css/style.css`, `assets/js/resilient-fetch.js`
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/247-tab-switching-performance.md`

**Test DL-247:**
- [ ] Switch to AI Review tab on first visit — no full-screen overlay, inline spinner or instant load
- [ ] Switch back to Dashboard after visiting AI Review — instant, no loading indicator
- [ ] Switch filing type (AR → CS) — no full-screen overlay, brief opacity fade
- [ ] Rapid tab switching — no duplicate API calls (check Network tab)
- [ ] After 30+ seconds, switch tab — silent background refresh fires
- [ ] Mutations (bulk send, save settings, mark complete) still show full-screen overlay
- [ ] Auto-refresh (5-min interval) still works silently
- [ ] Page visibility return still refreshes silently
- [ ] AI Review tab loads instantly after dashboard (prefetched)

## Session Summary (2026-04-09)

### DL-246: Split Modal Page Preview & Zoom [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** PDF split modal thumbnails (scale 0.2, ~120px) too small to read page content. Admins can't decide how to group pages.
- **Solution:** Lightbox-style page preview overlay with zoom/pan controls.
- **Features:** Hover magnify icon on thumbnails, lightbox with full-size page render (pdf.js scale 1.5), left/right arrow navigation, zoom controls (+/- buttons, scroll wheel, double-click toggle), drag-to-pan when zoomed, full keyboard support (arrows/Escape/+/-).
- **Files touched:** `github/.../admin/index.html`, `github/.../admin/css/style.css`, `github/.../admin/js/script.js`.
- **Code review fixes:** Canvas backing store release, `closeSplitModal` → `closePagePreview` chain, render race guard, `||` → `??` falsy-zero fix.
- Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/246-split-modal-page-preview-zoom.md`

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-07 — Part 3)

### DL-244: Rejected Uploads Visibility [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** When admin rejects an AI classification, the source upload (filename + date + reason) is lost. Client never learns we received a file we couldn't use; same docs keep being requested in approve-and-send + reminders.
- **Critical constraint:** Doc records must stay `Required_Missing` (NOT `Requires_Fix`) — the reject acts on the AI's *guess at a template slot*, not the client's actual document. Marking template slots would lie to the client about what they sent.
- **Solution:** New `rejected_uploads_log` JSON field on Reports table. Reject flow appends `{filename, received_at, reason_code, reason_text, notes, ...}` per rejection. Auto-clears when stage advances past Collecting_Docs.
- **Surfaces:** Amber callout titled "מסמכים שקיבלנו ממך בעבר" rendered above missing-docs list in:
  - approve-and-send email (Workers `email-html.ts` shared helper)
  - Type B reminder email (n8n WF06, both HE and EN branches)
  - Client portal view-documents.html
  - Admin doc-manager (with delete-only action under הודעות הלקוח)
- **Files touched:** `api/src/routes/{classifications,client,client-reports,stage,approve-and-send}.ts`, `api/src/lib/email-html.ts`, `github/.../assets/js/{view-documents,document-manager}.js`, `github/.../document-manager.html`, `github/.../admin/css/style.css`, `github/.../view-documents.html`, n8n workflow `FjisCdmWc4ef0qSV` (Search Due Reminders + Prepare Type B Input + Build Type B Email), `docs/airtable-schema.md`, design log `documents/244-rejected-uploads-visibility.md`.
- **Build:** `cd api && npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Not yet deployed/tested:** Worker deploy + manual end-to-end test plan in current-status TODO #0 + design log Section 7.

## Session Summary (2026-04-07 — Part 2)

### CS Questionnaire Labels — Strip `cs_` Prefix [COMPLETED]
- Bug: CS questionnaire columns in Airtable are prefixed with `cs_` (DL-182, to disambiguate from AR in shared submissions table). Prefix was leaking into the WF02 "full questionnaire" email, the admin questionnaires tab (view + print), and the doc-manager questionnaire panel (view + print). In RTL, `cs_חשבון בנק עסקי` rendered as `חשבון בנק עסקי_cs`.
- Investigated alternatives: renaming Airtable columns would require updating Tally→Airtable mapping, n8n WF02, `workflow-processor-n8n.js`, `question_mappings` rows, and `format-questionnaire.ts` hidden-field lists in lockstep. Rejected as too risky.
- **Fix:** One-line strip in `api/src/lib/format-questionnaire.ts:127` — `key.replace(/^cs_/, '')` before pushing to `answerEntries`. All four surfaces read `answers[].label` from this single formatter, so the server-side strip covers everything.
- **Deployed:** Worker version `13f18aca-d92a-4fb1-9828-a4de04b42b35`. Commit `2405e9b` (local outer repo only — no remote).
- Works for existing CS submissions immediately on next page load.

## Session Summary (2026-04-07)

### DL-242: Questionnaires-Tab Print — Notes & Client Questions [COMPLETED]
- Bug: printing from admin → questionnaires tab (single + bulk) omitted "שאלות הלקוח" and "הערות משרד" sections that DO appear when printing the same client from doc-manager.
- Root cause: `api/src/routes/questionnaires.ts` never returned `notes` per item; print fell back to a fragile `clientsData.find(...)` cross-reference. Client-questions parser also silently swallowed parse failures.
- **Worker fix:** API now fetches and returns `notes` + `filing_type` per item alongside the existing `client_questions`.
- **Frontend fix:** `generateQuestionnairePrintHTML` now reads `item.notes` / `item.filing_type` directly. Client-questions parser hardened to warn on bad JSON.
- **Deployed:** Worker `ecda4169-3084-4667-a87e-f52e9fce0e95`, submodule `4a687cd`. **Verified working in production.**

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-06 — Part 2)

### DL-238: Unified AI Review Tab (Both AR & CS)
- AI Review tab now loads all classifications regardless of entity tab (`filing_type=all`)
- Each card shows a filing type badge (`.ai-filing-type-badge` — blue for AR, purple for CS)
- Tab badge count is combined across filing types
- `switchEntityTab()` no longer invalidates AI Review cache (data unchanged)
- API: `classifications.ts` accepts `filing_type=all` and adds `filing_type` to response items
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING

### DL-239: Cross-Filing-Type Reassign
- Reassign combobox now supports cross-type — toggle buttons inside dropdown switch between AR/CS doc lists
- Toggle appears at the top of the dropdown only when client has BOTH active reports
- API: `clientToReports` map built from Airtable reports query (covers clients without pending classifications in sibling type)
- API: `target_report_id` param accepted in POST reassign for "create new doc" cross-type path
- Combobox dropdown re-anchors on window scroll/resize (was drifting away from input)
- Click input again while open closes dropdown (toggle behavior)
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING

### DL-241: CS Template short_name_he Issuer Placeholders
- Discovered CS docs in reassign combobox showed generic template names ("אישור מס – פנסיה") instead of per-issuer names
- Root cause: CS templates' `short_name_he` field in Airtable lacked `{varName}` placeholders that AR templates have
- Pure data fix — updated 17 CS template records via pyairtable
- Cleared `cache:templates` KV key in Workers
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING

### Test DL-238/239/241
  - [ ] AI Review tab shows both AR and CS classifications regardless of entity tab
  - [ ] Each card shows filing type badge (דוח שנתי / הצהרת הון)
  - [ ] Tab badge count is combined
  - [ ] Approve/reject/reassign still work
  - [ ] Reassign combobox shows toggle for clients with both AR+CS
  - [ ] Toggle switches the doc list to other filing type
  - [ ] Cross-type reassign succeeds (verify in Airtable)
  - [ ] Combobox dropdown stays anchored when scrolling page
  - [ ] Clicking input again while open closes the dropdown
  - [ ] CS docs in combobox show issuer names (e.g., "אישור מס – פנסיה – פנסיה1")
  Design logs: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/238-unified-ai-review-both-filing-types.md`, `239-cross-filing-type-reassign.md`, `capital-statements/241-cs-template-short-names.md`

### UI Design System Update
- Added `.ai-filing-type-badge` and `.doc-combobox-ft-toggle` patterns to `docs/ui-design-system-full.md`
- Documented combobox scroll/click behaviors

---

## Session Summary (2026-04-06)
- **DL-240:** Remove OneDrive subfolders (זוהו / ממתינים לזיהוי / מסמכים שזוהו)
  - Removed `folder` param from `uploadToOneDrive()` in `attachment-utils.ts`
  - Removed subfolder logic from `processor.ts` (both inbound paths)
  - Removed `/מסמכים שזוהו` from admin upload path in `upload-document.ts`
  - Removed `moveToZohu` from `classifications.ts`, simplified archive to 2-level traversal
  - All docs now land directly in filing type root: `{year}/דוח שנתי/filename.pdf`
  - **Deployed:** Build passes, pending deploy + manual testing

### Test DL-240: Remove OneDrive Subfolders
  - [x] Build passes (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
  - [ ] Inbound email → attachment uploads to `{year}/דוח שנתי/filename.pdf` (no subfolder)
  - [ ] Admin upload → file goes to `{year}/דוח שנתי/filename.pdf`
  - [ ] AI Review reject → file moves to `{year}/ארכיון/`
  - [ ] AI Review approve → file renamed in place
  - [ ] AI Review reassign → file renamed in place (no move)
  - [ ] Existing files in old subfolders still accessible
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/documents/240-remove-onedrive-subfolders.md`

## Session Summary (2026-04-05)
- **DL-237:** PDF split & re-classify from AI review
  - Created `api/src/lib/pdf-split.ts` — `splitPdf()` and `getPdfPageCount()` using pdf-lib
  - Added page count capture in `processor.ts` during inbound email processing
  - Added 3 Airtable fields: `page_count`, `split_from`, `page_range` to CLASSIFICATIONS table
  - Added `action=split` handler to `POST /webhook/review-classification` in `classifications.ts`
  - Added `/webhook/download-file` proxy endpoint for CSP-safe PDF download
  - Frontend: split banner on AI review cards when `page_count >= 2`, split modal with pdf.js thumbnails
  - Two split modes: "Split All" (one page per doc) and "Manual Ranges" (e.g., "1-2, 3, 4-5")
  - pdf.js v3.11.174 loaded lazily via CDN on first use
  - Fixed: CSP `blob:` for pdf.js worker, `.show` class for modal visibility, progressive thumbnail rendering
  - **Deployed:** API deployed, submodule pushed. Verified modal opens with 15-page PDF thumbnails.

### Test DL-237: PDF Split & Re-Classify
  - [x] Multi-page PDF (3+ pages) shows split banner on review card
  - [ ] Single-page PDF does NOT show split button
  - [x] Split modal opens with correct page thumbnails rendered via pdf.js (verified with 15-page PDF)
  - [ ] "Split All" mode creates one classification per page
  - [ ] "Manual Ranges" mode correctly parses "1-2, 3, 4-5" into groups
  - [ ] Invalid range input (e.g., "0, 99") shows validation error
  - [ ] Split PDFs are uploaded to OneDrive with `_part1`, `_part2` suffixes
  - [ ] Each split segment is classified independently (different template matches possible)
  - [ ] Original classification hidden after split (review_status = 'split')
  - [ ] New classification cards appear on refresh with correct client/report context
  - [ ] `split_from` field links children to parent in Airtable
  - [ ] `page_range` field shows correct ranges on child records
  - [ ] Verify no regression: approve/reject/reassign still work normally
  - [ ] Mobile: split modal is usable on small screens
  - [ ] New inbound multi-page PDF auto-populates `page_count` field
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/237-pdf-split-reclassify.md`

## Session Summary (2026-03-31)
- **DL-235:** OneDrive folder routing restructure
  - Renamed filing type folders: `דוחות שנתיים` → `דוח שנתי`, `הצהרות הון` → `הצהרת הון` (singular)
  - Moved `ארכיון` from inside filing type folders to year level (sibling of filing types)
  - Fixed `moveFileToArchive()`: 3-level parent traversal instead of 2
  - Fixed main review handler: split archive (3 levels up) vs זוהו (2 levels up, stays inside filing type)
  - 2 files changed: `attachment-utils.ts`, `classifications.ts`
  - **Needs deploy:** `wrangler deploy` to activate

### Test DL-235: OneDrive Folder Routing Restructure
  - [ ] Reject a classification → file moves to `{year}/ארכיון/` (NOT inside filing type folder)
  - [ ] Approve with override → old file moves to `{year}/ארכיון/`
  - [ ] Reassign unmatched doc → file moves to `{year}/דוח שנתי/זוהו/` (still inside filing type)
  - [ ] Inbound email attachment → uploads to `{year}/דוח שנתי/זוהו/` or `ממתינים לזיהוי/` (singular folder name)
  - [ ] Admin upload from doc manager → goes to `{year}/דוח שנתי/מסמכים שזוהו/` (singular)
  - [ ] CS document → uploads to `{year}/הצהרת הון/` (singular, not plural)
  - [ ] Existing files in old plural folders still accessible (no migration, old URLs unchanged)
  - [ ] Regression: approve standard (no conflict) → file renamed in place, no folder move
  - [ ] Regression: reassign matched doc → file renamed, stays in current folder
  - [ ] Regression: keep_both → new doc created, no archive move
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/documents/235-onedrive-folder-routing-restructure.md`

Previous (same day):
- **DL-222 (addendum):** Fixed client switcher in document-manager — was navigating with `report_id` instead of `client_id`, causing "Not Started" screen. 10 edits in switcher section, no backend changes. Tested & confirmed working.

- **DL-234:** Skip own outbound emails in inbound pipeline
  - Added `SYSTEM_SENDER` filter in `processor.ts` to skip emails from `reports@moshe-atsits.co.il`
  - Prevents system-generated emails from being added as client messages/notes
  - 4-line change, follows existing auto-reply filter pattern
  - Cleaned up 7 system-generated notes from Client Name test account
  - **Needs deploy:** `wrangler deploy` to activate the filter

### Test DL-234: Skip Own Outbound Emails
  - [ ] Send test email FROM reports@moshe-atsits.co.il → verify pipeline skips (Worker logs)
  - [ ] Send test email FROM real client → verify normal processing
  - [ ] Send test from another @moshe-atsits.co.il address → verify office forwarding still works
  - [ ] Trigger a reminder → verify reminder works AND inbox copy is skipped
  Design log: `.agent/design-logs/infrastructure/234-skip-own-outbound-emails.md`

- **DL-232:** Complete email & print filing type audit + fix
  - Audited all 9 email types + questionnaire print for AR/CS differentiation
  - Fixed Client Doc Request "has docs" case: subject + body now include filing type (Workers `email-html.ts`)
  - Fixed Type A reminder: header + 3 body paragraphs now dynamic (n8n WF[06])
  - Fixed Type B reminder: EN + HE body text now dynamic (n8n WF[06])
  - Fixed WhatsApp pre-filled text: generic across all emails (`email-styles.ts` + n8n nodes)
  - Fixed questionnaire print: title now "Name — Filing Type Year", meta shows "שאלון הוגש"
  - Applied print fixes to both admin `script.js` and `document-manager.js`
  - Fixed duplicate `reportClient` variable crash in print function
  - Corrected DL-222's assessment that Type A/B reminders were "DUAL" (only subjects were)
  - Deployed Workers + updated n8n WF[06] + pushed GitHub Pages

Previous session (same day):
- **DL-231:** Fix keep_both classification paths missing `document_key`, `document_uid`, `issuer_key`

Previous session (2026-03-30):

## Session Summary (2026-03-30)
- **DL-228:** Smart add second filing type — 4 features:
  1. Email blur auto-detect: typing an existing client's email shows inline banner with pre-fill option
  2. Row menu shortcut: "הוסף הצהרת הון/דוח שנתי" in dashboard table "..." menu (desktop, mobile, right-click)
  3. Doc manager button: "Add other type" next to filing tabs, calls import endpoint + page reload
  4. Tab linking: `viewClientDocs()` passes `&tab=filing_type` → doc manager opens correct tab
  - API: `client-reports.ts` now returns `client_email`/`cc_email` in office mode
  - CSS: `.existing-client-banner` (slide-down), `.field-prefilled` (yellow tint), `.add-filing-type-btn` (dashed blue)

Previous session:
- **DL-226:** Dual-filing classification + OneDrive folder architecture

## Priority Queue

_(empty — no P1 items)_

~~**P1 — Rotate Airtable PAT (secret leaked in design log)**~~ — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-16
- Leaked token `patvXzYxSlSUEKx9i.25f38a9e...` found in `.agent/design-logs/ai-review/112-webhook-dedup-and-issuer-display.md:94` (hardcoded in a DL-112 n8n Code node snippet captured in the design log).
- **Rotated:** User regenerated the token in Airtable. `.env` uses a separate token (`pat2XQGRyzPdycQWr`) — untouched.
- **n8n updated:** Only one *active* workflow (`QqEIWQlRs1oZzEtNxFUcQ` [02] Questionnaire Response Processing, node `code-clear-reminder`) had the old token hardcoded. Updated via MCP. Send Batch Status (`QREwCScDZvhF9njF`) is disabled, skipped. 3 archived workflows with the old token skipped (dormant + old token now dead anyway).
- **Redacted:** DL-112 line 94 → `'<redacted — see .env AIRTABLE_API_KEY / n8n credential>'`.
- **Committed:** `2a9ff3f` (bundled with `.agent/` tracking reorg).

~~**Bug: AI Review reassign dropdown shows already-approved/assigned docs**~~ — Fixed in DL-224

## Active TODOs

**Test DL-297: Doc-Manager — Sticky Header Merge + Editable Stage** — verify sticky bar reads as header top row and stage is click-to-edit
- [ ] Sticky bar: at page top, bar sits directly above page-header with no visual gap, reads as header top row.
- [ ] Sticky bar: scroll down → bar stays pinned at top, logo + title scroll away.
- [ ] Sticky bar: no double-margin below bar (old 44px spacer rule is gone).
- [ ] Stage: click stage label → dropdown appears below with all 8 stages.
- [ ] Stage: current stage visually highlighted in dropdown.
- [ ] Stage: select a different stage → label updates immediately, toast on success.
- [ ] Stage: backward move (e.g., Collecting_Docs → Waiting_For_Answers) → Airtable reminder fields reset (backend stage.ts logic).
- [ ] Stage: API error → label reverts, error toast.
- [ ] Stage: click outside dropdown → closes without change.
- [ ] Stage: Esc key closes dropdown.
- [ ] No console errors on doc-manager page load.
- [ ] Regression: sticky bar progress fill + summary text + actions still render correctly.
Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/297-doc-manager-header-sticky-stage-edit.md`

**Test DL-293: Doc-Manager — Full Client Edit (Pencil + Inline)** — verify pencil in doc-manager opens shared modal, inline edit works, dashboard modal unchanged
- [ ] Pencil icon appears in doc-manager client bar next to client name.
- [ ] Click pencil → modal opens with current name / email / cc_email / phone pre-filled.
- [ ] Edit name in modal → save → client bar updates without reload; dashboard also shows new name on next visit.
- [ ] Edit email → save → inline email field in bar updates to new value.
- [ ] Cancel (X or backdrop) with unsaved changes → DL-268 dirty-check prompt fires.
- [ ] Inline: click email `<strong>` → turns into `<input type="email">` LTR with current value selected.
- [ ] Inline: Enter saves, Escape reverts, blur saves (same as Enter).
- [ ] Inline: invalid email → validation toast, input stays open, no save.
- [ ] Inline: cc_email and phone behave the same (phone is free-text, no format validation).
- [ ] Dashboard modal still behaves identically — regression check DL-106 + DL-268 flows (dirty-check, change summary toast, optimistic update, cc_email row).
- [ ] `admin-update-client` audit log fires for both modal and inline edits.
- [ ] `GET_CLIENT_REPORTS` office response now includes `client_phone`.
- [ ] No console errors on doc-manager page load.
- [ ] Network: single fetch for initial load (not a separate call for phone).
Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/293-doc-manager-edit-client.md`

**Test DL-280 v2: Mobile Bottom Nav Root Fix (class-based FOUC gate)** — verify nav appears on mobile after auth, stays during scroll, doesn't flash pre-auth
- [ ] Fresh load on mobile viewport (DevTools 375px) with valid session → bottom nav visible immediately after splash fades
- [ ] Login from login screen on mobile → nav appears after auth completes (no flash before)
- [ ] Scroll the dashboard up/down on mobile → nav stays pinned to bottom across the entire scroll range
- [ ] Tab through dashboard → import → AI review on mobile → nav stays visible across all tabs
- [ ] Reload page on mobile with valid session (same-tab path) → nav appears
- [ ] New tab/window on mobile with valid token (verify+prefetch path) → nav appears
- [ ] Desktop (>768px) → nav still hidden (CSS `.bottom-nav { display: none }` outside media query)
- [ ] bfcache: navigate away + back with valid token → nav still visible
- [ ] bfcache: navigate away + back after token expiry → nav hides cleanly, login screen shown, no FOUC flash on next forward nav
- [ ] Chat widget audit: appears on mobile + desktop after auth, hides on bfcache restore with expired token (migrated from sibling-combinator to `.visible` class)
- [ ] Real iOS Safari + Android Chrome — verify safe-area inset on notched devices, no flicker during login screen render
Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/280-fix-mobile-bottom-nav-hidden.md`
**Test DL-290: Reminder "ממתין לסיווג" Card = AI Review Badge** — verify the two surfaces now show matching numbers
- [ ] Reload admin → note AI Review tab badge number
- [ ] Open Reminder tab → "ממתין לסיווג" card is within ±1–2 of the badge (small residual allowed for late-stage clients outside reminder scope)
- [ ] Dual filing-type client (AR + CS both Collecting_Docs with pending) → counts ONCE toward card (previously twice)
- [ ] Click the "ממתין לסיווג" card → filter still works (pre-existing: surfaces CD-scoped rows only — minor known divergence vs. card count, intentional)
- [ ] Regression: scheduled / due_this_week / suppressed card filters still work identically
Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/290-pending-classification-count-mismatch.md`

**Test DL-288: Queued-Subtitle Stale Flash** — verify dashboard load has no `(N בתור לשליחה)` flash
- [ ] Hard-reload `/admin` after 08:00 when no emails are queued → stage-3 card renders clean, no subtitle flash at any point
- [ ] Queue an email off-hours → reload → subtitle appears with correct Outbox-backed count after fetch resolves (~200-500ms), no intermediate wrong number
- [ ] Click the subtitle → `openQueuedEmailsModal()` opens with correct list (DL-281 regression check)
- [ ] Stage counts (stat-total, stat-stage1..8) still update correctly on the same dashboard refresh
Design log: `.agent/design-logs/admin-ui/288-queued-subtitle-no-stale-flash.md`

## Session Summary (2026-04-16 — DL-281 Queue View + Outlook as Source of Truth)

### DL-281: Queued Emails Modal + Outbox-Backed Truth [IMPLEMENTED — NEED TESTING]
- **Problem:** Dashboard `(N בתור לשליחה)` subtitle showed stale counts because `queued_send_at` never auto-clears after 08:00 delivery (DL-273 §8 known gap). Same staleness on doc-manager `ישלח ב-08:00` button. No way to see *which* clients were queued.
- **Fix:** Switched source of truth from Airtable `queued_send_at` to Outlook Outbox via MS Graph `PidTagDeferredSendTime`. Added `graph_message_id` Airtable field on `annual_reports`. Added `MSGraphClient.listOutboxDeferred(mailbox)` and new `GET /admin-queued-emails` route (60s KV cache). Frontend subtitle is now clickable → opens modal listing genuinely-pending Outbox messages.
- **Mid-session bug fix:** dropped 12-hour legacy fallback (was surfacing already-delivered records) + added `queuedEmailsLoaded` flag to avoid falling back to broken client-side filter.
- **Doc-manager fix:** added `isQueuedSendStillPending()` DST-safe helper so the lock button auto-unlocks once 08:00 passes.
- **Commits:** `81a1b36` (main feature) → `656920c` (legacy-rows fix) → `e58edaa` (doc-manager unlock; rebased onto DL-282)
- **Files:** `api/src/lib/ms-graph.ts`, `api/src/routes/approve-and-send.ts`, `api/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `frontend/admin/js/script.js`, `frontend/shared/endpoints.js`, `frontend/assets/js/document-manager.js`, `.agent/design-logs/email/281-queued-emails-outbox-source-of-truth.md`
- **Airtable:** `annual_reports.graph_message_id` (singleLineText, `fldVd7760NGefZeIw`)
- **Worker deployed:** version `e493b15e-d568-48ba-a2ff-977a0b1f5d9c`
- **Verified live:** Pending_Approval count of 60 confirmed correct via Airtable query (30 overnight approvals correctly moved to Collecting_Docs at approval time per DL-273).

### Active TODOs
N. **Test DL-281: Queue View + Outlook Source of Truth** — verify Outbox-backed list works end-to-end at next off-hours cycle
   - [ ] Approve a doc-request off-hours → confirm `graph_message_id` written on the report
   - [ ] Reply to a client message off-hours (threaded path) → confirm `graph_message_id` in note JSON
   - [ ] Reply non-threaded fallback → same
   - [ ] Click `(N בתור לשליחה)` → modal lists actually-pending Outbox messages
   - [ ] Tomorrow 08:00 → modal/count auto-clears as Exchange delivers (no manual refresh needed beyond ~60s cache TTL + page reload)
   - [ ] Manual Outbox deletion → next dashboard load reflects removal
   - [ ] Doc-manager send button auto-unlocks for clients whose 08:00 has passed
   - [ ] Throttling: 20 rapid dashboard loads = 1 Graph call (60s cache)
   - Design log: `.agent/design-logs/email/281-queued-emails-outbox-source-of-truth.md`

### Worktree cleanup (FS-side, manual)
- This session's worktree at `C:/Users/liozm/Desktop/moshe/worktrees/claude-session-20260416-072032/` had its git metadata corrupted mid-session (HEAD vanished — likely parallel session pruned it). All work was recovered via copy-to-main-and-commit. Inner files cleared, orphaned `.git/worktrees/claude-session-20260416-072032/` gitdir removed, but the now-empty parent dir is locked by this terminal — `rmdir` after closing this Claude session.
